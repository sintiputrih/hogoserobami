Fans were only given a few promos, no names, and very little to go off of. And&nbsp;of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">everything in Netflix's early 2021 lineup</a>, this show might be the most intriguing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But now, the gossip mills can stop: Christine Chiu is one of Netflix's picks for 'Bling Empire.' But who is Chiu, and what makes her life so glamorous?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Fans Can Expect From Netflix's 'Bling Empire'</a></span></p><p>First things first:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Reporter</a> called Chiu the "socialite wife of a plastic surgeon," which sounds like she technically doesn't have a career. The "Beverly Hills housewife" is married to celebrity plastic surgeon Dr. Gabriel Chiu, and multiple sources say she helps manage the medispa that she established with her husband.</p><p>Of course, Christine did attend Pepperdine and Stanford, says the site&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Chiu Reviews</a>, and she has a decade of experience in the&nbsp;public relations and beauty industries.</p><p>But as of 2016, she was making headlines on&nbsp;Hollywood Reporter for saying she didn't want celebrities' sloppy seconds when it came to buying couture gowns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The socialite explained that when she attended fashion shows and saw dresses she wanted on the runway, she'd place a deposit to purchase them. But&nbsp;then, she'd see celebs like Jessica Chastain or Kerry Washington wearing the gowns — which the ateliers put on loan — which frustrated her.</p><p>For example, during a 2016 meeting with Prince Charles (the Chius are opening a wellness center in collaboration with the Prince), Mrs. Chiu wore a gown that Kerry Washington appeared in a few months later.</p><p>Yep,&nbsp;Christine decided those $100K gowns are only going on&nbsp;her body if&nbsp;she feels she can pull the look off better than celebs who've worn them already.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anyway, wearing couture gowns and working with Prince Charles aren't the only things glamorous about Christine Chiu's life.</p><p>She and her husband have a son, but they also have two pet llamas — rescues, Christine confirms on Instagram. And while&nbsp;Dr. Chiu Reviews highlights all of Christine's philanthropic work and volunteerism (she's done&nbsp;a lot), the family also travels via private jet, takes quick jaunts to Aspen, and hires Santas with ponies for the holidays.</p><p>Christine also surfs (or at least poses) with Louis Vuitton surfboards, dresses her toddler in Dolce & Gabbana and Gucci, and lounges on private yachts in designer fashions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Basically, she does all the things the Kardashians do, except that all of her IG posts are accompanied by deep thoughts, inspirational quotes, and a stark lack of #ad hashtags.</p><p>By the looks of Christine's Instagram, 'Bling Empire' is going to be fast-paced, fascinating, and probably way better than watching <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">supposed divorce drama go down on 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians.'</a></p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angry Fans Are Fed Up With Kylie Jenner's Tone-Deaf Posts</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBursuipaBllaK9qr7EZpqhqpmowaq6xGaaoaGlZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fallout-shady-sands-explained.html><span>←</span><span>Fallout: Shady Sands, explained</span></a>
