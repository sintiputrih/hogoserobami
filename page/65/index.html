<a href=../../gpus-unleashed-intel-releases-first-unlocked-gpu-driver-for-oem-systems.html></a>
While Intel’s integrated GPUs have made immense strides over the past decade, there’s been one particular legacy they’ve been unable to break free from: OEM driver locking. Due to the large degree of customization and optimization that OEMs sometimes do to their systems, some OEMs have insisted on having video drivers “locked” to their platforms, so that only video drivers that they’ve customized and distributed can be installed.
This structure has always offered at least a modicum of utility, ensuring that newer drivers don’t break things or otherwise interfere with those system customizations.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>NFL RB Mike Davis and JD Mckissic Arrested On Cocaine Charges: Fans Notice Their Absence</h2><time>Jun 28, 2024</time>

External Appearance Externally, the design of the Raidmax RX-700AT PSU is very subtle and simple. If not for the fan finger guard with the thicker outer rim and parallel grid, it could be easily mistaken for yet another “run of the mill” product. Raidmax markets the RX-700AT as the “shortest 700W 80Plus Titanium” power supply, but the chassis is 165 mm long and will still not fit inside several cases that can only accommodate PSUs fully adherent to the ATX standard (160mm).</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Truth About Netflix 'Cowboy Bebop' John Cho's Net Worth</h2><time>Jun 28, 2024</time>
