Winslet was more inexperienced than DiCaprio, who was already a familiar face in Hollywood thanks to his role in the 1993 coming-of-age drama "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" and the 1996 Shakespeare-inspired "Romeo + Juliet." Winslet was a bag of nerves.&nbsp;"I was like probably how all the women in this audience are, about Leonardo DiCaprio," Winslet told Oprah Winfrey in 1998 (via <a href=#>Harper's Bazaar</a>). "Initially, I thought, 'Ugh, how am I gonna work with this beautiful man who's such a brilliant actor?'"</p><p>But it ultimately made the experience easier. When they co-starred as husband and wife in "Revolutionary Road" 11 years later, Winslet felt a lot more self-conscious about doing romantic scenes with DiCaprio, not only because she had known DiCaprio for years, but because the film's director was none other than <a href=#>Sam Mendes, Winslet's husband</a> at the time.&nbsp;"I was like, 'Is it just me who feels a bit weird about this? You know. My friend. My husband,'" Winslet told the <a href=#>Mirror</a> in 2008.</p><p>Winslet's feelings differed from DiCaprio's — and even from Mendes', for that matter. "Neither Sam nor Leo seemed the slightest bit bothered," she quipped. Her husband, in fact, didn't even seem to register it.&nbsp;"You can see this look of absolute intensity on his face and I knew all he was thinking about at that moment was the frame of the shot."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhobX95g46wn7Jlm5bBpnnWoqWspJWpeqW1w6erZqSZoLJut8isqqKml2K5prvNmqmdp12ZtqStz6ugqGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kelly-clarkson-absence-the-kelly-clarkson-show-explained-health.html><span>←</span><span>Kelly Clarksons time off The Kelly Clarkson Show explained - and why it could happen again</span></a>
