In a thinly veiled satire of Playboy magazine, she played Hazel Sharpe, a voluptuous campus queen who was being tempted by the devil and Orgy Magazine to become “Orgy Maiden of the Month”.</p><h2>Nichelle Nichols siblings: Thomas Nichols, Marian Michaels</h2><p>Nichelle is the third child of six children of Samuel Earl Nichols, a factory worker who was elected both town mayor of Robbins in 1929 and its chief magistrate, and his wife, Lishia (Parks) Nichols, a homemaker. Later, the family moved into an apartment in the Woodlawn neighborhood of Chicago.</p><p>Thomas Nichols and Marian Michaels are the famed siblings of Nichelle Nichols. Her brother Thomas died on March 26, 1997, while her sister Marian remains alive.
