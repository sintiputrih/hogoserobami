At 42, Bethenny is currently divorcing her husband of a whole three years, Jason Hoppy. This was her second marriage, she was previously married for a year, from 1997 to 1997, to an “entertainment industry executive” named Peter Sussman. Bethenny and Jason have a three year-old daughter together, Bryn, and chronicled their brief marriage on Bethenny’s reality show, “Bethenny Ever After”, the title of which became ironic after it ceased airing last year. (Bethenny now has a new talk show coming out called “The Bethenny Project”.) I only saw some segments of her reality show and was struck by how poorly Bethenny and Jason communicated, and how much they argued over trivial things. It doesn’t seem surprising to me that they didn’t last. Only Bethenny thinks that her personal pain is the worst thing that could happen to anyone. She really said something similar to that, and I don’t think I’m misconstruing it:</p><p>The 42-year-old reality star expressed her grievances to morning anchor Greg Kelly on Thursday while guest-hosting on “Good Day New York.”</p><p>“It’s rough,” she said. “I have to say, divorce is the most difficult thing you could ever go through in your entire life.”</p><p>While the creator of Skinnygirl cocktails expected the road to divorce from her husband of two years, Jason Hoppy, would be a bumpy one, she didn’t know how bad it would feel.</p><p>“I never heard how excruciating it is,” she described.</p><p>Frankel went on to say that the whole experience of divorce was a “brutal, unnatural situation” that she “never thought” she’d find herself in.</p><p>But amid all the rain Frankel’s found sunshine in her “amazing” 2-year-old daughter, Bryn.</p><p>“Kids make you do things you’d never do,” she said. “They bring out the best in you.”</p><p>And divorce can sometimes bring out the worst.</p><p>After Frankel filed for divorce from Hoppy in early January, he counter-filed three weeks later with aggressive demands. Her scorned ex’s papers requested primary custody of Bryn, child support, medical and dental expenses, and exclusive use of the couple’s Tribeca loft in New York City.</p><p>Some can speculate his demands are the result of a broken and bitter heart as Hoppy was spotted in a New York City park with Bryn on Monday still wearing his wedding ring.</p><p>“We have love and respect for one another and will continue to amicably co-parent our daughter who is and will always remain our first priority,” Frankel previously said in a statement. “This is an immensely painful and heartbreaking time for us.”</p><p><a href=#>[From The NY Daily News]</a></p><p>I get that divorce can be really difficult and gut wrenching and that, in this lady’s charmed life, this is the most difficult thing that’s happened to her. For people who have suffered tragedies though, that sounds ridiculous. What about car accidents, serious health problems, having a close loved one or – god forbid – a child dying? There is some sad, scary sh*t that can happen in life and it can happen randomly. Somehow a rich and semi-famous lady going through a divorce doesn’t seem even close to the “most difficult thing.” That’s not to lessen her pain, but she should have phrased it differently and made it more personal. As it is, she sounds kind of clueless and self-centered. I watched the interview (<a href=#>available on NYDN</a>) and she didn’t qualify it or anything either.</p><p>Bethenny and Jason in May, 2012<br><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/wenn3911884-911x1024.jpg alt title=wenn3911884 width=600 sizes="(max-width: 911px) 100vw, 911px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/FFN_Frankell_Hoppy_KET_030413_51030171-701x1024.jpg alt title=FFN_Frankell_Hoppy_KET_030413_51030171 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/FFN_Frankel_B_SNAPPER_022013_51018934-726x1024.jpg alt title=FFN_Frankel_B_SNAPPER_022013_51018934 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photo credit: WENN.com and FameFlynet</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZma3Fha4R2e8Geq6GdnqPGoLLRmqWknZyUsarCzquanpeZqKy1tMSYpKirpJSxqrLFopqupKSUwam1zaCWsqellLCwwcudlp6ulaesqLu%2BrZ%2Brp6WctaC1zZiwqK2ilLKvwMirnJikmZuycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rachel-marshall-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-664910-html.html><span>←</span><span>Rachel Marshall Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
