Regarding the duo, Animal said:&nbsp;</p><p>“I wish The Ascension nothing but the best and hope they are successful. I know they are just doing what they are told, but when they run down teams like the Road Warriors and Demolition before ever accomplishing anything, they will be dead in the water. The fans today are just too smart for that and you can tell by their reaction. You have to look the part. Hawk and I did and we were allowed to be an extension of ourselves. The Ascension is being fed a part by Hollywood writers, not all of whom understand the business. At the same time, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.”</p><h2>Finn Balor Update</h2><p>It is expected than <a href=#>Finn Balor</a> will bring back body paint and a more theatrical entrance when he faces <a href=#>Adrian Neville</a> at <a href=#>NXT Takeover: Rival</a> next week.&nbsp;</p><p>Balor is known for using body paint on the independent scene, a look he carried over to NXT and used at the NXT December live special. Balor was said to be reserving the grander entrance and paint for bigger NXT shows; he used a “Carnage” themed look&nbsp;(Marvel)&nbsp;at the December show but there is no word of what he may use this time around.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwgZRpZ2tpXae8orCMsJirqpmkv26tzaKkmqRdmLyuucSnq6xln6N6tbTEZpism5WjwKq7zWadoqaeYq%2BiuM6rZJuqmaO0qrrGZpmam5tir7Cw2GanmqGeqQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./raspberry-white-chocolate-muffins.html><span>←</span><span>Raspberry White Chocolate Muffins Modern Honey</span></a>
