They started making music in the early ’80s, heavily influenced by funk and punk rock.</p><p id=par-3_32>Drummer Chad Smith and guitarist John Frusciante joined, and RHCP released their first majorly successful album, Mother’s Milk. That was followed by hit records like Blood Sugar Sex Magic and Californication.</p><p id=par-4_61>They’ve sold more than 60 million albums, collected six Grammys, and been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame since then. So, it might be no surprise that MTV chose RHCP to receive its 2022 Global Icon Award. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>, they will receive the honor from <a href=#>Cheech Marin</a> and <a href=#>Tommy Chong</a> at the Video Music Awards ceremony.</p><p id=par-5_54>A source told the outlet they considered Johnny Depp to present but opted for the classic comedy pair. No matter who presents the award, RHCP is also set to take the stage for a VMAs performance. It will be the first time they’ve done that since they received the Video Vanguard Award in 2000.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>Anthony Kiedis and Flea both have an astounding net worth</h2><p id=par-6_44>According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Kiedis’ net worth is approximately $155 million. He owns $30 to $40 million of high-dollar real estate around the United States.

He owns multiple multi-million dollar properties and has made lucrative real estate deals. For example, he spent $10 million on a two-acre estate in 2006 that sold for $20 million in 2020.</p><p id=par-9_30>Like Kiedis, Flea wrote a memoir called Acid for the Children, which also made the NYT Best Sellers List.
