In fact, so contentious a twosome were they that it wasn’t until the last moment that viewers — or the lovers themselves — could be sure that a wedding was going to take place. Fearing that a ring on her groom’s finger would make him no less prickly and impossible than he’d always been, Mary developed a case of cold feet that was so bad, she at first couldn’t walk, much less march down the aisle.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>44. Adam and Sharon, The Young and the Restless</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-472939250.jpg><p>“This was Mom’s,” the groom (then Michael Muhney) told his bride before slipping a chilly wedding band onto her finger in 2009. Mind you, what he&nbsp;should’ve said was “This is yours” before placing back into Sharon’s arms Faith, the baby he’d let her believe was dead so that he could replace the unborn child he’d caused stepmother Ashley to miscarry by putting on the worst drag act since Jiggly Caliente.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>43. Steffy and Finn, The Bold and the Beautiful</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/yr-adam-sharon-winter-wedding-ss.jpg><p>This photo from “Sinn’s” 2021 wedding may make it look like the grandmother of the bride disapproved of the match. But the late, great Stephanie was no doubt as relieved as viewers that her namesake had finally gotten off the marry-go-round with on-again/off-again husband Liam to “play doctor” with someone who had never dated her half sister. At least until it was revealed that Finn wasn’t your run-of-the-mill, unusually ripped M.D. but the surprise son of indefatigable madwoman-about-town Sheila. Then we’re sure the queen bee rolled over her grave.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>42. Carly and Jason, General Hospital</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/JPI_bb62121_0001928632.jpeg><p>Not bad for a wedding that didn’t even have a honeymoon! The BFFs’ 2021 marriage was supposed to be one of convenience. But then a familiar flickering began between the old flames, one that became decidedly inconvenient when the Widow Corinthos’ “late” husband Sonny rose from the grave to reclaim the role that his hired gun had taken a shot at filling.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>41. Amber and Rick, The Bold and the Beautiful</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/jason-carly-wedding.jpg><p>The couple’s 2001 remarriage should serve as a reminder to always check your guest list — repeatedly. It was all well and good that it included Eric and Stephanie, the groom’s father and stepmother. But on second thought, it probably should have left off Deacon, who refused to take “Amber’s just not that into you” for an answer. Also, where the heck were the Forresters supposed to get a spare plate of dry salmon to serve him at the reception? Dry salmon doesn’t grow on trees, people!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>40. Taylor and Ridge, The Bold and the Beautiful</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bb-rick-amber-wedding-2001-jp.jpg><p>“Should anyone present know of any reason that this couple should not be joined in holy matrimony…&nbsp;” &nbsp;Er, yeah. You can tell from a glance that Steffy did indeed know of a reason that her parents shouldn’t remarry in 2022. And since Mom wasn’t about to tell Dad that he’d only dumped spare wife Brooke because son Thomas had faked a call from her to Child Protective Services — long story —&nbsp;Steffy revealed the truth herself. She wanted her folks to reunite, sure, but in a romantic, sensible way…&nbsp;like if a pine cone fell on Ridge’s head and knocked some sense into him.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>39. Cord and Tina, One Life to Live</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/119191_0332.jpg><p>Oops. Did we type “Cord and Tina” rather than “Max and Tina”? Our bad. But you can understand why we would get mixed up, can’t you, considering that at this unforgettably awkward 1988 wedding, the bride only blushed after accidentally inserting into her vows her former husband and true love’s name instead of that of the playboy with whom she was supposed to be tying the knot.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>38. Hilary and Neil, The Young and the Restless</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/oltl-tina-max-wedding-abc-screenshot.png><p>The “something borrowed” at this ill-fated 2014 wedding was the bride; the “something blue,” the groom, he just didn’t realize it yet. Why? Because even before he went temporarily blind, he refused to notice the way that adopted son Devon sulked anytime he was canoodling with the younger man’s future stepmother. Seriously, look at this picture. Is Devon’s the face of someone you’d want to make a toast at your reception?</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>37. Pete and Melissa, and Mickey and Maggie, Days of Our Lives</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/neil-hilary-married-yr-ss.jpg><p>Proof positive that love conquers all: The Hortons, who never should have divorced in the first place, threw a double wedding in 1986 with their adopted daughter and the former gang member who’d once shot his future father-in-law during a rumble and given his fiancée a preview of her bachelorette party during what he’d intended to be a secret stint as a stripper. Man, the 1980s were fun.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>36. Chance and Abby, The Young and the Restless</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/days-double-wedding-maggie-mickey-melissa-pete-columbia-triastar-television-ec.jpg><p>We somehow doubt that the second wedding of Victor and Ashley’s daughter will be her last. But we’ll still never forget it, owing to the fact that the groom’s portrayer, Donny Boaz, was out sick when the ceremony was taped in 2020, so the show brought in as a replacement… Justin Gaston, the real-life husband of Melissa Ordway (Abby). How’s that for art imitating life!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>35. Sheila and Eric, The Bold and the Beautiful</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/yr-gaston-ordway-wedding-hw.jpg><p>Aaarrrggghhh! He was so close to not getting tangled up in the Young & Restless villainess’ web of deceit. But after the psycho got scared off from their 1993 wedding by archenemy Lauren, the bride from hell came back and managed to convince <span>the eager dupe</span> her would-be husband to say the two little words (“I do”) that would leave him for years saying an altogether different phrase (“Oh crap!”).</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>34. Kimberly and Shane, Days of Our Lives</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-02-at-7.12.45-PM.png><p>Hail, hail, the gang was all here for the star-crossed lovers’ wedding. And why wouldn’t it have been standing-room only at the nuptials, considering everything that the bride and groom had endured to make it to the church, never mind make it to the church on time. If she wasn’t sleeping with Machiavellian Casanova Victor to save Shane’s life, the couple was playing a “Who’s the daddy?” story and/or trying to chase down their son, who — this being just their luck — had gone straight from his first diaper change to his first abduction.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>33. Nina and Cliff, All My Children</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-485283122.jpg><p>Despite the fairy-tale trappings of the Warners’ spectacular 1980 wedding at Cortlandt Manor, “happily ever after” was still a ways off for the Pine Valley pair, owing largely to the fact that&nbsp;Cliff couldn’t figure out how to add into his vows to Nina a promise to “love, honor, cherish and tell you if I ever knock up a nurse. Oh, speaking of pregnant nurses… ” Yeah, it was like that.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.4808868501529><h2>32. Mariah and Tessa, The Young and the Restless</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/amc-cliff-nina-wedding-peter-bergman-abc-ec.jpg><p>Well, that’s one way to ensure that your wedding will be “dyn-o-mite!” The brides-to-be involved Mariah’s half brother and Tessa’s still-besotted ex-boyfriend Noah to participate in the planning of their 1970s-themed nuptials. Nevertheless, the ceremony turned out to be not only hella groovy but hella historic: In 2022, “Teriah” became the first same-sex couple to get married on the soap. “Telling stories about what the world really looks like,” Camryn Grimes told <a href=#>GLAAD</a>, “only has an opportunity to bring people in, not isolate them.” Amen to that!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>31. Jax and Brenda, General Hospital</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mariah-tessa-wedding.jpeg><p>We know. It’s weird that the groom isn’t even in his wedding picture. But that’s only because his 1996 nuptials were really all about his bride’s ex-lover, Michael Corleone wannabe Sonny, who showed up at the ceremony with a surprise guest in tow: Jax’s “dead” wife, Miranda. As you can see, Brenda took the revelation in stride. Would you say that that constituted “taking out a hit” on her old flame?</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>30. Phyllis and Nick, The Young and the Restless</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/gh-brenda-punches-sonny-wedding-abc-ec.jpg><p>When you think of these Genoa City sophisticates, who went from illicit hookups to real love, you probably don’t think of spare ribs and beer, bolo ties and cowboy boots. Yet, due to circumstances too Byzantine to explain here, the future Newmans were inspired to take off for Texas and two-step down the aisle at a honky-tonk bar ahead of daughter Summer’s grand entrance into the world.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>29. Quinn and Eric, The Bold and the Beautiful</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/yr-phyllis-nick-2006-wedding-bl.jpg><p>The fifth time’s the charm? Erm, maybe not. There was a reason that Eric’s family chose to RSVP “no” when he took as wife No. 5 (unless you count remarriages) the madwoman who’d once pushed niece Ivy off a bridge and might have killed Ricardo Montemayor. And no, it wasn’t that Quinn would soon pull a Brooke and find herself drawn to stepson Ridge — it was, you know, all that other stuff!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>28. Roman and Marlena, Days of Our Lives</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bb-quinn-eric-gallery-wedding-jp-1.jpg><p>You not only survived the Salem Stalker’s reign of terror but cracked the case; what are you going to do next? If you said, “I’m going to Disney World,” you’re not Salem’s top cop and the Doc who never failed to provide him with TLC. In 1983, they instead promised to love, honor and cherish one another until death did them part. Which, for better or worse, it did a lot.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>27. Alan and Lucy, General Hospital</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/days-roman-marlena-wedding-Columbia-TriStar-Television-Courtesy-Everett-Collection.jpg><p>As if predicting the way that all of Port Charles would ultimately describe their disastrous marriage in the future, the soon-to-be Mrs. Quartermaine exclaimed to her would-be better half that “it was a terrible, terrible mistake” when he got a gander at the gold digger at the altar in her scarlet-red wedding gown in 1990. The lovers had scarcely managed to say “I do” before Lucy had “I done it” with Scotty!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>26. Drucilla and Neil, The Young and the Restless</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/gh-alan-lucy-red-hat-wedding-sjodin-abc-ec-e1712693226865.jpg><p>Maybe the third time would’ve been the charm. As it was, the Winterses only got to marry twice before their love story was cut short by one tragedy (Neil died in his sleep) after another (Dru went off a cliff). At least their 2003 “I do”-over was especially lovely, taking place as it did in Japan and including among the guests their teenage daughter, Lily…&nbsp;who was actually the biological child of her Uncle Malcolm. On second thought, this remarriage was doomed from the start. Some things simply don’t boil down to location, location, location.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4><h2>25. Mason and Julia, Santa Barbara</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/JPI_yr111203_50494.jpeg><p>When the groom discovered in his pocket not his wedding vows but his grocery list, he blurted out, “Milk, butter, ground beef… These I pledge you for the rest of my days.” From there, he just winged it, agreeing not to floss in the bedroom and adding, “Certainly, other women are out of the question.” Julia wasn’t going to change her mind about him, was she? “You promised me butter and ground beef and wanna know if I’m gonna change my mind?” she replied. Nope. Her answer was and (almost) always would be “yes.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.6070528967254><h2>24.

As the groom’s portrayer, Lamon Archey, pointed out, “Elani” was “the <a href=#>first African-American couple to get married on Days</a> in 54 years!”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>23.

Fresh from his first broken engagement to Hope in 2011, daytime’s most notorious waffler did what any unable-to-be-single fella did and took off for Aspen, where he exchanged vows on a mountaintop with her sometime stepsister — blissfully unaware that she and his father had arranged for his virginal ex to get stuck in a gondola so that she couldn’t interrupt the wedding.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>22.

The couple, in typically atypical fashion, had ridden off on the groom’s bike and wound up becoming husband and wife, dragon and phoenix, at the Noodle Buddha restaurant.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>21.

Totally. We could’ve just as easily included in this countdown the deathbed remarriage of “Hevon.” But our eyes are puffy enough as it is, so we can’t afford the tears. And besides, we’d rather think of the couple in happier times, like 2015, when their dreams of a future together still had a snowball’s chance in hell of coming true.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>20.

No. That would be the fact that shortly after the ceremony, the groom (then Ronn Moss) was kidnapped by abduction enthusiast Sheila and presumed dead, which led his “widow” to do what anyone would do in her headdress and shtup <span>Jack Wagner</span> her brother-in-law, Nick.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>19.

The otherwise beautiful 2020 wedding of “Cin” ended in more explosive a fashion than even a speech by a drunken best man could bring to bear. Still steamed about the groom’s stint as a serial killer — imagine! — Eve avenged her daughter’s senseless murder by blowing up the ceremony, kidnapping Ben and attempting to brainwash him into giving his newly-minted missus a fatal neck rub.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>17.

Now there is no loneliness. We are two bodies, but there is one life before us.” Yeah, tough to top that.

In 1984, the high-school sweethearts graduated to husband and wife in a ceremony that neither they nor fans could believe was really happening. After a jealous Liza had done her damnedest to keep them apart, and paralysis had made it look like the groom wouldn’t be able to walk down the aisle (or anywhere), the youngsters tied the knot in an especially moving ceremony…&nbsp;that was soon followed by Jenny’s death-by-jet-ski courtesy of her off-his-rocker ex-fiancé, Brent.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>11.

But, although Marlena’s love for her groom was real, his identity was… er, not. He was no more Roman Brady than he was Roman Polanski; he was John Black, the perpetual pawn of the nefarious Stefano. Still, it was a glorious ceremony, complete with the bride rocking a Christmas-tree topper. And did you try the scampi at the reception? To. Die.
