They expected him to grow up and eventually work alongside them at the lumber company.</p><p class=fh>Young Harry made his first acting appearance in eighth grade playing the character Billy Bud in a play of the same title.

If he was unsuccessful, he planned to become a child psychologist as he loved working with children.</p><p class=fh>He began his acting career by appearing in 30 commercials but landed his first movie role in 1974 in "The Lords of Flatbush." He played a member of a Brooklyn gang in the movie.</p><p class=fh>Henry rose to fame after ABC Studios cast him on their new series "Happy Days" in 1974.

Thankfully, that changed when fans fell in love with Fonzie.</p><p class=fh>The show's popularity continued to grow, and Fonzie became an iconic character with his leather jacket, motorcycle, thumbs-up gesture, and usage of "Aayyyy!" becoming TV trademarks.</p><p class=fh>The 27-year-old Jewish man from New York was the biggest star on the biggest show with 22 million weekly viewers. Henry was also reportedly very polite, and he stayed on the show until production canceled it in 1978.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/05c005d50f5664db725114e7ee4abdd5.jpg><p class=xj data-testid=image-source>Henry Winkler attends The Paley Center For Media Presents An Evening With Henry Winkler at the Beverly Wilshire Four Seasons Hotel on February 12, 2020. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=fh>After "Happy Days," Henry turned to movie production when he could not get roles as an actor. He produced and directed movies like "MacGyver" in 1985 and "Sabrina the Teenage Witch" in 1996.</p><p class=fh>He returned to acting in 1996 with the movie "Scream" and "The Waterboy" in 1998. The actor also appeared on shows like "The Practice" (1997) and "Arrested Development" (2003).</p><p class=fh>Henry won his first-ever Primetime Emmy Award in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series category for the HBO series "Barry."

While there, he realized most of the symptoms were similar to those he experienced as a child.</p><p class=fh>Henry revealed he spent his younger years believing he was stupid due to his learning difficulties. He felt relieved at the realization that what happened to him had a name and he was not stupid. But he was also angry he had to deal with that.</p><p class=fh>Henry explained he was grounded for 97% of his high school years and mostly only saw the moon through his window. The actor declared those hardships encouraged him to succeed and appreciate his differences, which prompted him to write a book, reach out and educate others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f3ec9fee10ec4e161df295cf5e63db01.jpg><p class=xj data-testid=image-source>Henry Winkler attends a meet-and-greet for his and Lin Oliver's new book "Alien Superstar" at Barnes & Noble at The Grove on October 13, 2019. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=fh>He explained that it also made him realize there are many roads to success.

Henry and Oliver have since written 29 books over the space of 15 years. The books are written with different variations of dyslexia in mind as the condition differs in people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/1f8b878684912d9e0a7ef56bbff7a4a0.jpg><p class=xj data-testid=image-source>Henry Winkler attends Vulture Festival 2021 at The Hollywood Roosevelt on November 13, 2021. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class="fh gh">Thus, the books contain ample white space on each page, and they are</p><p class="fh gh">in the Dyslexie font to improve legibility for the dyslexic brain.
