To investigate the audio quality issues more in depth and to verify that it’s not just some side-effect of my measurement rig, I went ahead and dismantled the headphones and soldered in measurement cables into the speaker’s inputs so we can actually also measure the electrical audio signal from the DAC.
I limited my measurement to one channel on the right speaker for practical reasons, as anyhow the key measurements and characteristics we saw are present on both channels."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

But even when taking this into account, overall distortion on the GSA70 is still higher.</p><p align=center><a href=# id=daccciflink><img alt id=dacccifimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/14608/GSA670-DAC-GSA-CCIFA.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>I had made all measurements while calibrating the output voltage to the 1KHz signal test, so again it’s interesting to see that for the Bluetooth measurement here again it went quite further down in amplitude for the higher frequency fundamentals.</p><p>There’s notable distortion above 20KHz and this was confirmed by what we saw in the FR curve. On the GSA70 this time around we again see a ton of distortion elements in the lower frequencies, showcasing some worse off results.</p><p align=center><a href=# id=dacsmptelink><img alt id=dacsmpteimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/14608/GSA670-DAC-GSA-SMPTEA.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>In the SMPTE test notice how the 60Hz peak doesn’t change all that much in amplitude compared between the two connections as opposed to the much lower 7KHz tone in the BT measurement. Distortions on BT oddly enough again are lower frequency, but also lower than on the GSA70.</p><p align=center><a href=# id=dacdinlink><img alt id=dacdinimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/14608/GSA670-DAC-GSA-DINA.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>On the DIN test we again see a similar patterns – lower higher frequency volume on the BT test, but also lower distortions.</p><h2>Overall Audio Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, I’m not too sure what to make of the GSP670’s audio performance. On one hand, the actual speakers as well as drivers seem to be very high quality and it seems that in that regard they’re very much typical of Sennheisers within this price-range.</p><p>However, the core issue of the headphones is that they seemingly fail when it comes to the actual electrical signal output as well as the DAC quality of the CSR8670 ASoC that the company opted to use for powering these headphones.</p><p>My two main gripes are the headphone’s idle noise behaviour as well as the too high distortions on the GSA70 which are very much noticeable in every-day listening. Both these issues fundamentally are characteristics of a too weak DAC – the 16bit resolution of the unit just doesn’t cut it as it doesn’t have enough headroom to drive down the noise floor below audible levels.</p><p>The inter-modulation behaviour and differences between the GSA70 and Bluetooth are also hard to explain. Both behaved off the mark, but in the end the Bluetooth output did however give a much better sound experience.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH51go9xZq2glWLAprrNoZyiq5Wneqi%2Fz29uaWWnnr%2BmuMSsqmafkaK2r7OMoZyanKOawW6%2BxK%2Bgnq9fag%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./camila-coelho-and-caro-coelho-have-welcomed-their-first-child.html><span>←</span><span>Camila Coelho And Caro Coelho Have Welcomed Their First Child</span></a>
