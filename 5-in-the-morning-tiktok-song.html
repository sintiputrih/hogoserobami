Each unique video escapes your mind just as quickly as it entered it — that is, until a particular song piques your interest.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The clock app is famous for popularizing songs like <a href=#>Doja Cat</a>'s "Say So," Saucy Santana's "Material Girl," and MUNA's "Silk Chiffon" featuring Phoebe Bridgers, to name a few. But every once in a while, an obscure remix makes its rounds on the app, and this time the mashup comes from a Baltimore-based DJ. With lyrics like "I said, '5 in the morning' / I wake up to fight for my earnings," let's discuss the trending tune.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">TikTok's "5 in the morning" audio was spawned from the work of a Nigerian singer and producer.</h2><p>TikTok user and DJ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@djzayy</a> posted his remix of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nigerian singer Tems</a>'s song "Free Mind" in January 2022. The song comes from her 2020 album For Broken Ears. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify</a>, Tems's music "brings an urban sound" that embodies a "fusion of alternative R'n'B and Neo soul genres."</p><p>The first verse includes lyrics like "The fear in my mind is a warning / Praying to the one you rely in / I've been wandering all day / I try to be fine but I can't be"; meanwhile the chorus repeats the lyrics "I rеally need, I really need time now / I really need, I need a free mind now."</p><p>The song sees the singer attempt to free herself from the prison of her mind.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In @djzayy's viral remix of the song, high-pitched plucking sounds can be heard throughout. His <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">original TikTok video</a> has been played over 265,000 times, and his official audio has been used in over 32,000 videos.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The viral audio is used in TikTok's "Free Mind" dance challenge.</h2><p>Like many viral TikTok tunes do, @djzayy's unique remix has found its way in a TikTok dance challenge. In this case, however, it may have to do with the fact that the DJ titled his audio "Djzayy free mind challenge."</p><p>The dance that correlates to the audio has actually been around for years, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Baltimore Banner</a>. It's been deemed the Park Heights Strut. A man named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bunkey Jr.</a> further popularized it, putting his own fresh spin on the dance and renaming it after himself. That's a power move.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“The Park Heights Strut is a regular ol’ little two-step and that’s it. With the Bunkey Jr. Strut, you got the two-step, you got the legs, you got the spin, you got everything with it,” he told the publication. “I’ve been doing this forever, since I was a kid, and I just did my own little thing with it and that’s what everybody is doing.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>There are clearly several layers to the "Free Mind" challenge, but specifically regarding the accompanying dance, Bunkey Jr. feels that it positively unifies the city of Baltimore.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfanqquoytn55lnaS%2Fr7XNoGStoZupvKx50qiloA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./one-episode-in-and-the-new-season-of-succession-is-already-bringing-the-memes.html><span>←</span><span>One episode in, and the new season of Succession is already bringing the memes</span></a>
