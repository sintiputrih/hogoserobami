Aniston rejected him and opted for the twosome to <a href=#>remain platonic</a>.</p><p>“At first it was like, she would walk in, I’d be like, ‘Hey, good to see you.’ And I’d go to my dressing room and just go, ‘Oh, I’ll never, I’ll never be able to be with her,’” he recalled during a November 2022 appearance on SiriusXM’s The Jess Cagle Show. “But how can you not have a crush on Jennifer Aniston, you know? But I did at one point just go, ‘All right, that’s enough.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jennifer-Aniston-and-Matthew-Perry-s-Touching-Quotes-About-Each-Other-4.jpg><h3>Coming to His Aid</h3><p>Perry admitted in his memoir, <a href=#>Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing</a>, that he struggled with substance abuse for most of his time on the hit series. In the book, Perry revealed that Aniston <a href=#>confronted him</a> about his problem.</p><p>“‘I know you’re drinking,’ she said. … I was confused. ‘How can you tell?’ I said. I never worked drunk,” he wrote. “‘We can smell it,” she said, in a kind of weird but loving way, and the plural ‘we’ hit me like a sledgehammer.”</p><p>As Perry faced a series of ups and downs, he credited Aniston for <a href=#>being there for him</a> when he needed it.</p><p>“She was the one that reached out the most,” Perry told <a href=#><strong>Diane Sawyer</strong></a> in October 2022. “I’m really grateful to her for that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jennifer-Aniston-and-Matthew-Perry-s-Touching-Quotes-About-Each-Other-3.jpg><h3>Their Sweet Texts</h3><p>After Perry’s passing, Aniston shared a <a href=#>series of text messages</a> between herself and her former costar.</p><p>“Making you laugh just made my day. It made my day :),” Perry texted Aniston, alongside a throwback photo of them together. She replied, “Awww the first of THOUSANDS of times … ”</p><h3>Saying Goodbye</h3><p>Aniston penned a touching tribute in honor of Perry following his death.</p><p>“Having to say goodbye to our Matty has been an insane wave of emotions that I’ve never experienced before. We all experience loss at some point in our lives. Loss of life or loss of love,” she wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a>. “Being able to really SIT in this grief allows you to feel the moments of joy and gratitude for having loved someone that deep. And we loved him deeply. He was such a part of our DNA. We were always the 6 of us. This was a chosen family that forever changed the course of who we were and what our path was going to be.”</p><p>She continued: “For Matty, he KNEW he loved to make people laugh. As he said himself, if he didn’t hear the ‘laugh’ he thought he was going to die. His life literally depended on it. And boy did he succeed in doing just that. He made all of us laugh. And laugh hard.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jennifer-Aniston-and-Matthew-Perrys-Friendship-and-Sweetest-Quotes-Over-the-Years.jpg><h3>Inside His Final Moments</h3><p>“He was happy. He was healthy. He had quit smoking. He was getting in shape. He was happy — that’s all I know,” Aniston told Variety in December 2023 <a href=#>of Perry’s mindset</a> before his death. “I was literally texting with him that morning, funny Matty. He was not in pain. He wasn’t struggling. He was happy.”</p><p>She added: “I want people to know he was really healthy, and getting healthy. He was on a pursuit. He worked so hard. He really was dealt a tough one. I miss him dearly. We all do. Boy, he made us laugh really hard.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZ6jtqex0WaYp6GjqbyvecCnm2alkanBqbHWZqeeqqKuwG6uxKyrZp6inrKvsNKhoKlloaq8tbHSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-nature-stone-expensive-html.html><span>←</span><span>Is Nature Stone expensive?</span></a>
