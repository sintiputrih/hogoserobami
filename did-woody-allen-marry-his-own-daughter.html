His grandfather arrived in the United States as immigrants from Austria and Panevys, a city in Lithuania.</p><h2>Did Woody Allen marry his own daughter?</h2><p>Woody Allen technically married his stepdaughter. His longtime partner Mia Farrow’s adoptive daughter, Soon-Yi, was his actual adopted child. Depending on the duration and nature of their relationship, Mia and Allen may qualify as a common law spouse under the law.<br>Since December 1991, Soon-Yi Previn and Woody Allen have been dating (Soon-Yi was 21 years old). They got hitched on December 24, 1997, in Venice.</p><p>Mia Farrow and André Previn’s adoptive daughter is Soon-Yi Previn. This explains why she goes as Soon-Yi Previn rather than Soon-Yi Allen. Stunning, no?</p><p>Mia Farrow and Woody Allen have been dating for 12 years. However, they were never wed and did not live together. Woody Allen resided in a Fifth Avenue apartment. On Central Park West, Mia Farrow and her children resided. In reality, during the course of 12 years, Woody never once spent the night at Mia’s apartment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51ksaqwjLCmqJypYq6tuMSnZKaZoqfGbrTIrGSor55isaLBxqGrnqpf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./corsair-unveils-new-icue-rgb-pro-xt-liquid-cpu-coolers-240-280-360mm.html><span>←</span><span>Corsair Unveils New iCUE RGB Pro XT Liquid CPU Coolers: 240, 280 &amp;amp; 360mm</span></a>
