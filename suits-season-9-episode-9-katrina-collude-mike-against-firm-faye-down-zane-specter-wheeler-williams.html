The character is making a comeback and, this time, he will hopefully fix things instead of making things worse.</p><p>In the promo for 'Thunder Away,' we see that Mike is backing Samantha Wheeler (Katherine Heigl) in her legal battle against Faye Richardson (Denise Crosby) and the whole firm is hoping that this will work out in their favor.</p><p>As fans know, Mike had returned earlier this season, picked a fight with his mentor Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht), and in the process of luring taunting him, managed to offend Samantha. Not one to take an ego hit in her stride, Samantha decided to fabricate evidence that led to Mike losing the case, despite knowing that Faye is watching closely. She put two and two together and figured out that Samantha broke the law and fired her from Zane Specter Litt Wheeler Williams.</p><p>If you have been paying attention, you know that Faye did not have evidence that Samantha broke the law, only instinct and it is this technicality that allows the latter to go after her. The Zane Specter Litt Wheeler Williams cavalry is with Samantha spiritually because all of them still work for the firm, which is under the control of Faye. To this end, Harvey and Louis (Rick Hoffman) are even forced to represent her in the legal battle.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Katrina Bennett (Amanda Schull), Alex Williams (Dulé Hill), and Donna Paulsen (Sarah Rafferty) are praying that Team Mike and Samantha wins. Even as they fear the worst, Katrina is approached by Mike to help out, except that it would involve her colluding against her own firm, and we know Katrina would never do that. We even hear her say as much in the promo for 'Thunder Away.'</p><p>She is willing to help, nonetheless, and if we know Mike, we think he will find a loophole that allows her to help him without actually having to break the law.</p><p>Watch Season 9 Episode 9 of 'Suits' to find out what that loophole might be when it airs on Wednesday, September 18.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoq6WewbR50p6YrKeeYoZusc%2BiqqiclWKGbrfAramippFisLC4y66bnmWdnrimecCgmKKmo6l6p7XRpmSfmamaeqW71qdks5memnq0vMScq56qXay1prHLnqlmr5mhuaqtzKw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./megan-rapinoe-retirement-after-2023-womens-world-cup-nwsl-season-7558561.html><span>←</span><span>Megan Rapinoe Is Hanging Up Her Cleats After the 2023 Season</span></a>
