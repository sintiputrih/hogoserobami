However, not all characters are open to polyamory. Some companions are open to the idea, while others are strictly monogamous or have specific requirements for accepting polyamorous relationships with certain characters.</p><h3>How many people can you romance in Baldur’s Gate 3?</h3><p>Baldur’s Gate 3 offers the opportunity to romance multiple characters. There are eight romancable characters in the game, including all of your Origin characters and three potential companions: Astarion, Gale, Halsin, Karlach, Lae’zel, Minthara, Shadowheart, and Wyll. However, there are two companions you are unable to romance: Minsc and Jaheira.</p><h3>Can you sleep with everyone in BG3?</h3><p>Yes, it is possible to begin a romance with multiple Origin Characters in Baldur’s Gate 3. However, once you commit to one character and have a sex scene with them, there may be consequences. Some characters may not be happy with your decision to pursue multiple romantic relationships, while others may not have any issue with it. It ultimately depends on the individual characters and their preferences.</p><h3>How does romance work in BG3?</h3><p>To enter a romance in Baldur’s Gate 3, you need to gain the approval of the character you are interested in. Increasing your approval rating with each potential love interest is essential.

However, it is important to note that not all characters are open to polyamory. Some characters may have specific requirements or restrictions regarding polyamorous relationships. It is best to explore the possibilities and communicate with the characters to understand their preferences.</p><h3>Who has the best romance in BG3?</h3><p>In my opinion, Shadowheart offers the best romance option in Baldur’s Gate 3. While she may be hesitant to open up at first, investing time in bonding with her can lead to a deep and loyal relationship. Shadowheart is a dedicated companion who will stay by your side as long as you remain loyal to her.</p><h3>What are the consequences of romance in BG3?</h3><p>In general, there are no major consequences for being in a romantic relationship with multiple allies at once in Baldur’s Gate 3. However, some characters may express their preference for monogamy and voice their discomfort if you pursue multiple romantic interests. It is important to consider the individual characters’ feelings and make choices that align with their preferences in order to maintain healthy relationships.</p><h3>Can you sleep with your guardian in BG3?</h3><p>Yes, it is possible to romance your guardian in Baldur’s Gate 3. Once you progress to Act 3, you will learn more about your guardian’s identity and personality. If your guardian shows interest in a romantic relationship and you reciprocate those feelings, you can pursue a romantic connection with them.</p><h3>Can you romance Karlach and Shadowheart in BG3?</h3><p>Based on player experiences, it seems that romancing both Karlach and Shadowheart simultaneously is not possible in Baldur’s Gate 3. After romancing Karlach, Shadowheart acknowledges the relationship and remains as a friend to the main character.</p><h3>Can you romance Jaheira?</h3><p>No, Jaheira is not a romanceable option in Baldur’s Gate 3. While there were previous statements indicating that all companions would be romanceable, Jaheira does not offer a romantic storyline in the game.</p><h3>How many endings are there in Baldur’s Gate 3?</h3><p>Baldur’s Gate 3 offers multiple endings, and the developers have made efforts to ensure that players rarely experience the same ending twice. The game provides unprecedented freedom in character creation and choices, allowing for a wide variety of outcomes and storylines.</p><h3>Can I romance Astarion and Karlach?</h3><p>Based on player experiences, romancing both Astarion and Karlach at the same time in Baldur’s Gate 3 is not possible. After the romantic scene with Karlach, Shadowheart simply expresses her happiness for the main character’s relationship with Karlach and remains as a friend.</p><h3>Can you romance Halsin in BG3?</h3><p>Yes, it is possible to romance Halsin in Baldur’s Gate 3. To unlock Halsin’s romance scene, you need to reach Act 3. Make your way through Wyrm Crossing, and if your approval with Halsin is high enough, you may trigger the romance scene.</p><h3>Can you have poly relationships in BG3?</h3><p>Yes, polyamorous relationships are possible in Baldur’s Gate 3, but only with certain characters. Some characters are open to the idea of polyamory, while others may have different relationship preferences.
