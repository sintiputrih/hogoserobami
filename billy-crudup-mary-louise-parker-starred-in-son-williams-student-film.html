So that’s fun. But he’s [also] incredibly supportive.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Billy-Crudup-Reveals-He-and-Ex-Mary-Louise-Parker-Starred-in-Son-William%E2%80%99s-Student-Film-2.jpg><p>Crudup shared some of his son’s criticism, including, “You suck, Dad.”</p><p>The Tony nominee and Parker, 55, welcomed William in 2004, shortly after Crudup ended their relationship to date <a href=#><strong>Claire Danes</strong></a>.
