But according to the singer, her then-stylist, Andrea Lieberman, attempted to talk her out of wearing the gown for fear of it being a fashion faux pas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was a dress that other people had worn already. My stylist was like, 'Please don't wear it. Somebody else has worn it.' I was like, 'Well, you bought it, and it looks the best, so I'm going to wear it.' And so I did. And it caused quite a stir," Lopez explained in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vogue video</a> of her breaking down 17 of her best looks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though very different visually, Lopez compared the gown to Marilyn Monroe's billowing white halter dress from&nbsp;The Seven Year Itch and the effect it had on pop culture.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I guess every generation needs its iconic kind of Marilyn dress, and this is that dress for this generation," said Lopez. "Why it became that? It was just a moment when the wind blew open, and I walked out onto the stage, and it just kinda happened."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After wearing the dress to the Grammy Awards in 2000, Lopez prompted the creation of Google Images due to the gown becoming the website's most popular search query they had seen at the time. Almost 20 years later, Lopez walked Versace's runway <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>in a similar version of the dress</a> during Milan Fashion Week.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"20 years had gone by, and I think for women, knowing you can put on a dress 20 years later — it resonated," she said of recreating the moment in 2020 in an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vanity Fair</a>.
