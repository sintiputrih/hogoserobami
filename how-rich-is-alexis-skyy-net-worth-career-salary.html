Net worth, Career, Salary</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Alexis Skyy</strong> will be joining the group on vacation for Season 2 of Family Reunion: Love & Hip Hop Edition. The reality star, who has a net worth of $500 thousand, is one of the franchise’s few cast members who has been on three of the episodes.</p><p>The show’s synopsis is as follows:</p><p>“For the first time, cast members from the Love & Hip Hop series take the celebration to international seas, convening in Jamaica to soak up the tropical sun and let go of their inhibitions.”</p><h2>Alexis Skyy’s Net worth.</h2><p>The Family Reunion: Love & Hip Hop Edition star has starred as a recurrent cast member on Love & Hip Hop’s Atlanta, Hollywood, and New York editions.&nbsp;The Dominican-Jamaican model, socialite, and rapper hails from Long Island, New York, and used to be a stripper before becoming famous as Fetty Wap’s girlfriend. The reality star’s massive net worth stems partly from her stint on the VH1 program. While she has yet to emerge as a prominent cast member of the program, her time there has been noteworthy, keeping fans interested.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Lucia-Pena-1.jpg alt="Lucía Peña" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She founded the Belle Sky Spa in Atlanta in 2016. Skyy was first featured on Love & Hip Hop Atlanta in 2016, then in the Hollywood part in 2017. She was featured on Love & Hip Hop New York from 2018 to 2019. The reality personality is well-known for her feuds, both online and offline.</p><h2>Alexis Skyy’s Love & Hip Hop journey</h2><p>In season five, the Family Reunion: Love & Hip Hop Edition star debuted in the Atlanta part of the show while posing for Tammy Rivera’s swimwear line. She then featured as Jessica Dime’s date in season 6.&nbsp;Her participation in the Hollywood series brought her a lot of recognition, as her conflict with Masika Kalysha became the show’s major emphasis. Skyy is now past the conflict, but when it occurred, all hell broke loose.</p><p>Masika, Moniece, and Misster Ray were on one side of the conflict, while Skyy, Hazel, Nikki, Zell, and Lyrica were on the other. The two had had a quarrel for years, but it all started on Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood when Alexis claimed that Masika became pregnant with Fetty Wap while the two were still in a relationship.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Lucia-Pena-2.jpg alt="Lucía Peña" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The season also included her romance with Solo Lucci, although Alexis had a falling out with Sara Scott, his child’s mother. After signing a record contract with Shotti, the prospective Family Reunion: Love & Hip Hop Edition star eventually starred in season 9 of Love & Hip Hop: New York.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifqK9dp7aktIyiqmaZnJrFqr%2BMrKKysV2jsrV51qipraBdmK6zscSrZKyZnJa%2Funs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./unas-cuantas-balas-por-sapo-domain-6-video-on-del-narco-blog.html><span>←</span><span>Female Grooming - Haircuts, Styles, Beauty And Makeup Guide</span></a>
