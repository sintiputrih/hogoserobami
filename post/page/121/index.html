In the brightest hour of my darkest day,
I realized what is wrong with me.
Can't get over you,
Can't get through to you.
It's been a helter-skelter romance from the start.Take these memories

Of a paper man cut into shreds
By his own pair of scissors,
He'll never forgive her,
He'll never forgive her...
Because days come and go,
But my feelings for you are forever</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Bryant Tardy - Age, Family, Bio</h2><time>Apr 1, 2024</time>
