Melanie Lynskey, Daniel Kwan, and the creators of Yellowjackets are among the many industry professionals who advocated for a strike to expand the WGA’s negotiating power in an environment where writers say streaming has sharply reduced their pay. “I stand with the WGA members voting to strike!” Lynskey tweeted. “There is no industry without writers. They deserve to be able to make a living!” Even Seth Meyers, whose show, Late Night With Seth Meyers, is — given the quick pace of late-night TV production — one of the first shows to go down in the event of a strike, showed support for a then-potential strike. “I’m incredibly grateful that there are negotiators for both sides sitting and talking,” Meyers said in his “Corrections” segment on April 24. “I’m incredibly hopeful that they can come to an agreement. I also feel very strongly that what the writers are asking for is not unreasonable. As a proud member of the guild, I’m very grateful that there is an organization that looks out for the best interests of writers.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clh5p5wpx000d3b6w5ldawvn5@published data-word-count=46>At the Met Gala Monday evening, Quinta Brunson, creator and star of Abbott Elementary, expressed her support for her fellow writers. “I’m a member of WGA and support WGA, and them getting — we, us — getting what we need,” she <a href=#>said</a> on the red carpet.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clge7lxgj00153b6v2ygr94yq@published data-word-count=61>New industry standards have left writers underpaid and overworked, the guild says.
