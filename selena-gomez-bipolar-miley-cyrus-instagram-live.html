"After years of going through a lot of different things, I realized that I was bipolar,” Selena said. “So when I go to know more information, it actually helps me. It doesn’t scare me once I know it. And I think people get scared of that.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The stigma of mental health problems was an obstacle she had to overcome. “I’ve seen it, and I’ve seen some of it even in my own family, where I’m like, ‘What’s going on?’ I’m from Texas. It’s not known to talk about your mental health," she told Cyrus. "You’ve got to seem cool, and then I see anger built up in teenagers and young adults because they are wanting that so badly. I just feel like, when I finally said what I was gonna say, I wanted to know everything about it and it took the fear away.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In recent years, Gomez has been open about living with mental health issues. Last year, while accepting the 2019 McLean Award at the McLean Hospital for her work on destigmatizing the public perception of mental health, she said, "It felt like all of my pain and my anxiety washed over me all at once, and it was one of the scariest times of my life. I sought support and the doctors were able to give me a clear diagnosis. The moment that I received that emotion, I actually felt equal parts terrified and relieved. Terrified, obviously, because the veil was lifted but relieved that I finally had the knowledge of why I suffered for so many years with depression and anxiety."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">About 4.4 percent of U.S. adults will experience the effects of bipolar disorder in their lifetimes, according to the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/bipolar-disorder.shtml data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Institute of Mental Health" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">National Institute of Mental Health</a>.<br></p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
