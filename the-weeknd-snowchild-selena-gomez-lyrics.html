Coincidence? I think not.</p><p>Selena turned 28 on Wednesday, July 22. Meanwhile, <a href=# id=auto-tag_the-weeknd data-tag=the-weeknd>The Weeknd</a> hopped on Twitter Wednesday morning to announce that his official music video for “Snowchild” would be dropping “in a couple hours.” By Wednesday afternoon, the 30-year-old singer shared the link to the video on his social media accounts.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/selena-gomez-love-on.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/timothee-kylie-selena-taylor.png><p>The anime-style music video was produced by D’ART Shtajio, the “first black owned anime studio,” according to a tweet by Tesfaye. In it, the singer cycles through past versions of himself as a performer. But fans also noticed that there are potential hints hidden in the music video—many of which seem to address his <a href=#>ex-girlfriend, Selena</a>. It wouldn’t be the first time The Weeknd has <a href=#>referenced his ex</a>, nor is it the first instance that fans see the similarities in Selena’s rumored <a href=#>songs about him</a>.</p><p>This time around, some of those features include balloons within the very first 20 seconds of the music video for “Snowchild”—a possible reference to Selena’s birthday—whereas others noted the backdrop of several scenes appear similar to the “Lose You to Love Me” singer’s photoshoots, including houses and staircases. It’s worth noting, however, that other fans have interpreted the balloon imagery as a reference to the House of Balloons-era mixtape released by The Weeknd in 2011.</p><p>But if the music video references aren’t enough to convince you, there are still more hints that have fans talking. Namely, Selenators know that their idol has said that “Snowchild” was her favorite song by The Weeknd in the past. In fact, the singer even listed the track on her official “Cooking Together” playlist on Spotify in April.</p><p>Even though it’s been over three years since Selena and The Weeknd dated in 2017, the potential references to each other in their music still haven’t let up. Whether it leads to a rekindled romance or friendship, we’re all for it. But see the hints for yourself: Keep on reading for The Weeknd’s “Snowchild” lyrics and music video, below.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2>Verse 1</h2><p>I used to pray when I was sixteen<br>If I didn’t make it, then I’d probablymakemy wrist bleed<br>Notto mislead, turn my nightmares intobig dreams<br>Whole squad mobbin’ even though we only six deep<br>I was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys<br>Walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze<br>I was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like Gillespie<br>Niggas had no homes, we were living in the dead streets<br>You couldn’t find me like I’m Hoffa<br>Cover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups<br>Spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up<br>Taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up<br>And I had nothing to believe in<br>Double cup leanin’<br>Couldn’t even breathe and<br>For that money I was fiending<br>Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving</p><h2>Chorus</h2><p>Leaving, leaving into the night<br>Now a nigga leaving, leaving<br>Leaving into the night, oh</p><h2>Verse 2</h2><p>She like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship<br>Futuristic sex, give her Philip K dick<br>She never need a man, she what a man need<br>So I keep on falling for her daily<br>We was at Coachella going brazy<br>Stack a couple M’s like I was Shady<br>Now I’m in Tribeca like I’m Jay-Z<br>Rockin’ Sorayama like he pay me<br>I just signed a new deal with Mercedes<br>Got me movin’ dirty like I’m Swayze<br>All my diamonds dancing like they Swayze<br>All my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee<br>Jet so big got a business and a coach<br>Always livin’ on the road, rockin’ Louis à la mode, nigga<br>And for that money, I been fiending<br>Cali was the mission, but now a nigga leaving</p><h2>Chorus</h2><p>Leaving, leaving into the night<br>Now a nigga leaving, leaving<br>Leaving into the night, oh</p><h2>Bridge</h2><p>Twenty mill’ mansion, never lived in it<br>Zero edge pool, never dipped in it<br>Superstar neighbor in my business<br>Paparazzi tryna catch me slippin’ and<br>Going on tour is my vacation<br>Every month another accusation<br>Only thing I’m phobic of is failing<br>I was never blessed with any patience</p><h2>Chorus</h2><p>So a nigga leaving, leaving, leaving into the night<br>Now a nigga leaving, leaving<br>Leaving into the night, oh</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ilpai2pHuQampybWNlfLW0xGaunp2bo7Fuv82orpygmaGxbr%2FEpZynmV2cvK6x2WajsqqZmMBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leah-remini-takes-scientology-battle-to-clearwater-political-race.html><span>←</span><span>Leah Remini Takes Scientology Battle to Clearwater Political Race</span></a>
