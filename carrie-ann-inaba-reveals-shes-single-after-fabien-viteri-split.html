Finding the strength to accept that it’s over is enormously painful,” she wrote alongside a photo of the sun setting over the ocean. “Losing your friend … losing the hopes and dreams … your partner … the person you shared everything with .. your person … your love. It’s hard.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Talk cohost</a>, who is on a <a href=#>temporary leave from the show</a> due to health concerns, revealed that she is “not going to fake that I am OK” after the recent breakup. Instead, she wrote that she plans to “celebrate my emotions, because it tells me that I’m alive and that my heart loves deeply.”</p><p>The Hawaii native added: “It was real. True love. And I’m so sad it’s over. But I’m grateful it happened. So very grateful.”</p><p>The <a href=#>TV personality</a> announced in September 2020 that she had found love with Viteri, who is from her neighborhood in Los Angeles, while speaking with her Talk cohosts.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I have fallen in love and I am now in a <a href=#>committed relationship</a>,” she gushed at the time. “He’s older than I am, and he’s a wonderful human being. And now, I understand how a relationship can work. He’s been so supportive and a mature adult ‘cause maybe sometimes I’m not, so that’s working really well.”</p><p>Inaba last posted a photo with her former flame and one of their dogs <a href=#>in honor of Earth Day on April 22</a>. Earlier that month, Viteri shared a video montage of the couple from <a href=#>their trip to the Santa Ynez Valley in California</a>, where they camped by a lake.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Carrie-Ann-Inaba-Says-She-Sad-Hopeful-After-Fabien-Viteri-Split-002.jpg><p>The <a href=#>former dancer</a> previously dated <a href=#><strong>Artem Chigvintsev</strong></a> from 2006 to 2009.
