At the end of each episode, audiences had an unexplainable sense of belonging to a workplace they could love and be annoyed by, all while laughing, crying, and generally having a great time.&nbsp;The Office&nbsp;gave us the best and the worst boss ever, Michael Scott, the sweet relationship between Jim and Pam, and the immortal line, “Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.” Even if the series ended a while ago, its allure is still strong. With the show’s increasing ratings came more fame for its stars.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=699 data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true>After winning a Golden Globe for his depiction of Michael Scott,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Steve Carell</a>&nbsp;proved himself to be an actor capable of switching effortlessly between humor and drama.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Krasinski</a>&nbsp;has gone from playing the lovable Jim Halpert to playing an action hero in&nbsp;Jack Ryan&nbsp;and is now branching out into filmmaking with&nbsp;A Quiet Place.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mindy Kaling</a>, aka Kelly Kapoor, not only acted on&nbsp;The Office&nbsp;but was also a writer and executive producer, laying the groundwork for her successful career as a showrunner. These professional achievements have increased the actors’ net worth to unprecedented heights. So, let’s do a full office audit based on how much each cast member is worth.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-10-oscar-nunez-5-million data-injectable=false>10. Oscar Nuñez — $5 Million&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=754 data-injectable=true>First, there’s Oscar Nuñez, the accountant we know as Oscar Martinez. He remained calm and collected in the middle of office mayhem, serving as a voice of reason for everyone. The character broke new ground in many ways, notably as one of the first gay characters on network television. But Nuñez’s talent doesn’t stop at Dunder Mifflin. Post&nbsp;The Office, he continued to ride the wave of success with several notable roles.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=507 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true>Remember his hilarious turn as Councilman Rodriguez in&nbsp;Brooklyn Nine-Nine?&nbsp;Or his portrayal of Papi in the critically acclaimed series&nbsp;Mr. Iglesias? And let’s not forget his cameo in the hit Netflix show&nbsp;Never Have I Ever, created by fellow&nbsp;The Office&nbsp;alum Mindy Kaling. It wasn’t just his acting that brought in the big bucks. Nuñez has dabbled in reality television as a judge on&nbsp;The Masked Dancer&nbsp;and had a stint in the film&nbsp;The Proposal&nbsp;alongside Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds.</p><h2 id=h-9-craig-robinson-6-million data-injectable=false>9. Craig Robinson — $6 Million&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=764 data-injectable=true>To fans of&nbsp;The Office, Craig Robinson’s portrayal of Darryl Philbin, the no-nonsense Dunder Mifflin warehouse foreman, was always a welcome change of pace. Whether advocating for warehouse safety, integrating himself into the office staff, or discreetly teasing his coworkers, Darryl’s moments were always entertaining. As a result of Robinson’s charismatic performance, the supporting character Darryl swiftly became a series regular.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=516 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>Robinson’s film credits include notable parts in comedies like&nbsp;Pineapple Express,&nbsp;Hot Tub Time Machine, and&nbsp;This Is the End. Robinson also fronts a band called The Nasty Delicious, and they’ve performed on shows like&nbsp;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.&nbsp;He has also voiced characters in hit animated programs, including&nbsp;American Dad,&nbsp;and starred in various TV shows as the main character, such as&nbsp;Ghosted&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mr. Robinson, expanding his acting resume.</p><h2 id=h-8-ellie-kemper-9-million data-injectable=false>8.

Kemper’s portrayal of the innocent and naive Erin was endearing. There were numerous funny and touching moments on the show due to the contrast between her and the more pessimistic characters and because of her charming, quirky, and cheerful demeanor. Fans also responded well to her romance arcs, especially those involving Andy Bernard (Ed Helms).</p><p data-characters=632 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>After her stint on&nbsp;The Office, Kemper found significant success in other projects, further boosting her fame and net worth. Most notably, she played the title character in the Tina Fey and Robert Carlock comedy series&nbsp;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. She was nominated for multiple awards and won two Primetime Emmys for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her performance, which critics widely praised.

Novak is a well-known actor, comedian, writer, and director who starred as Ryan Howard on&nbsp;The Office. While best known for his role as the ambitious and often ethically ambiguous temp turned executive, Novak also contributed to the show as a writer and director. Ryan Howard’s character development is among the most dramatic in&nbsp;The Office, transitioning from a quiet temp to a corporate executive before falling from grace and eventually returning to the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch.</p><p data-characters=619 data-current-count=619 data-injectable=true>Novak’s achievements extend far beyond&nbsp;The Office, though. Among the films in which he has had a role are&nbsp;Inglourious Basterds,&nbsp;Saving Mr. Banks, and&nbsp;The Founder.&nbsp;He has also provided his voice for well-known animated films, including&nbsp;The Smurfs&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Amazing Spider-Man 2.

Her on-again, off-again romantic connection with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) was a key storyline throughout the show’s nine seasons. Following&nbsp;The Office, Kinsey enjoyed success in a variety of other ventures, expanding her reach in Hollywood and increasing her net worth.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=592 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=true>From 2016–2017, she co-starred in the Netflix comedy&nbsp;Haters Back Off&nbsp;with Colleen Ballinger (aka Miranda Sings) as Miranda’s doting and occasionally naive mother, Bethany.

Lieberstein was also a writer and producer before becoming a showrunner in season five. After&nbsp;The Office, Lieberstein continued to work behind the scenes, producing and writing for shows such as&nbsp;The Newsroom,&nbsp;Ghosted, and&nbsp;Space Force. He has directed episodes of&nbsp;The Office&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Mindy Project, proving his versatility in television.</p><p data-characters=591 data-current-count=591 data-injectable=true>Rainn Wilson, on the other hand, is best known for his portrayal of Dwight Schrute, the eccentric and beet-loving assistant to the regional manager (later regional manager himself) at Dunder Mifflin. Wilson’s portrayal of Dwight on&nbsp;The Office&nbsp;is widely regarded as one of the show’s high points, and the character’s outlandish actions and memorable phrases have made him a fan favorite. Wilson’s acting career has been fruitful outside of the show as well. He has guest starred on&nbsp;Star Trek: Discovery&nbsp;and Mom, and his film credits include&nbsp;Super&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Meg.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-4-jenna-fischer-16-million data-injectable=false>4.

In 2007, Fischer received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for her portrayal of Pam, a receptionist turned office administrator at Dunder Mifflin’s Scranton location. Fischer’s portrayal of Pam Beesly was honest and down-to-earth, lending an air of realism to the show’s typically heightened depiction of office politics.
