This brings out Ring of Honor World Television Champion Samoa Joe.</p><p>Samoa Joe welcomes him back to Ring of Honor but tells him he brought something to the ring that greatly offends him. Joe says there can only be one Television Champion in Ring of Honor. Joe says he knows the powers that be don’t want this to happen but he doesn’t see any of them out there and challenges him to a match tonight.</p><p>Before ZSJ can answer, he’s interrupted by Christopher Daniels and Matt Sydal. Daniels says that’s an interesting suggestion but he said Joe can’t make matches. Daniels makes the case that Sydal should be a future Television Champion.</p><p>Sydal said he’s only here for the big matches and Daniels asks who wants to give Sydal a shot at a title. ZSJ said he has a cunning plan and suggests he and Joe team up to take on Daniels and Sydal next week with the caveat that if they pin either man, they can get a future title shot.</p><p>Sabre said once they deal with Daniels and Sydal maybe then they can determine who the true Television Champion is.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><ul><li>Toa Liona pinned The Boy, who wasn’t the legal man.
