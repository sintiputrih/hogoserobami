The 101-day experiment was dubbed the S*x Raft.</p><p>It was the subject of the 2018&nbsp;documentary film&nbsp;The Raft, by Marcus Lindeen, who started his research on Santiago‚Äôs experiment before he died. Santiago had picked ten diverse participants from around the globe and sailed with them.</p><p>They set sail across the Atlantic Ocean aboard a small engineless raft, dubbed the Acali. The purpose of this three-month experiment was, Genov√©s proposed, to find an answer to world peace.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-get-to-know-santiago-genoves>Get to know Santiago Genoves</h2><p>Spanish-Mexican anthropologist Santiago Genoves&nbsp;was affiliated with the National Autonomous University of Mexico. He is known for designing the 1973 Peace Project experiment, in which he and ten other people aimed to find peace.</p><p>They sailed on the Acali raft from the Canary Islands to Mexico. From Spain, Santiago died on September 5, 2013, aged 89, he was also one of the researchers who co-authored and signed the&nbsp;Seville Statement on Violence&nbsp;in 1986.</p><p>Before the Peace Project, Genov√©s had been part of the&nbsp;Thor Heyerdahl Ra expedition.
