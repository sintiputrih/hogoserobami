She connected the dots and went to get her engagement ring's authenticity tested.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Randall and his original jeweler claimed the ring to be worth $150,000. Upon further investigation, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the diamond was actually worth something in the teens</a>. According to Lala, the jeweler she brought the ring to told said the diamond was "mostly brown" and had "been treated by one or more processes to change its color."</p><p>Never one to back down in the face of confrontation, Lala immediately reached out to the original designer of the ring, Richie Rich, to confront him about the discovery.
