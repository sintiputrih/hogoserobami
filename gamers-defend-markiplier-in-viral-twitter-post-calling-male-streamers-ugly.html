The text reads, “Why are male YouTubers so ugly?”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=634 data-injectable=true>That insult didn’t land well with several fanbases, but Markiplier fans, in particular, dominate the thread with their various defenses of him. Comments like “Markiplier is one of the most beautiful humans I’ve ever seen” and “Take Mark off of the list” are endlessly echoed by adoring supporters.</p><p data-characters=149 data-current-count=149 data-injectable=false>Their efforts haven’t yet paid off, as the original poster doubled down on their insult, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">comparing the YouTuber to an egg</a> in a follow-up post.</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>This isn’t the kind of post that any creator should have to find themselves caught up in. These comments can only stir up negativity that adversely impacts the streamer and those who support them. In an age where mental health and self-image problems are far less taboo than they were before, it’s an easy call to say that criticizing someone’s appearance is a reductive and inappropriate thing to do on the internet.</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>We may still live in the days of Mean Girls-style antagonistic threads a while longer, but if more people follow the lead of Markiplier’s remarkable fanbase, then there may be light at the end of this dark tunnel.</p><i>Gamepur is supported by our audience.
