She announced her diagnosis in Friday's edition of Jessica Yellin's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>"News Not Noise" newsletter</a>, telling the journalist that she learned of her diagnosis while promoting season 2 of her Hulu Show Life & Beth.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"While I was doing press on camera for my Hulu show, I was also in MRI machines four hours at a time, having my veins shut down from the amount of blood drawn and thinking I may not be around to see my son grow up," Schumer said. "So finding out I have the kind of Cushing that will just work itself out and I'm healthy was the greatest news imaginable."&nbsp;<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added that "having the internet chime in" on her appearance alerted her that something wasn't right. "It has been a crazy couple [of] weeks for me and my family," the comedian explained. "Aside from fears about my health, I also had to be on camera having the internet chime in. But thank God for that. Because that's how I realized something was wrong."&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But that doesn't mean Amy is excusing the internet's body-shaming comments. When asked why she was open to sharing her personal medical information, Schumer revealed that she wants to "advocate for women's health."&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The shaming and criticism of our ever-changing bodies is something I have dealt with and witnessed for a long time. I want so much for women to love themselves and be relentless when fighting for their own health in a system that usually doesn't believe them," she said, before concluding that her diagnosis proves that "we never know what is going on with someone."&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Everyone is struggling with something," she added. "Maybe we can all be a little kinder to each other and ourselves."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-more-in-celeb-news></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>More in Celeb News</span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wKawZquTncKusdFmmq6rmJ67qHnSsqWdqp%2Bism6wyJqep6ejnsBuhJRycHBpZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./allison-and-marie-jose-benitez-found-or-missing-link.html><span>←</span><span>Allison and Marie Jos Benitez: Found or Missing, the Investigation Continues</span></a>
