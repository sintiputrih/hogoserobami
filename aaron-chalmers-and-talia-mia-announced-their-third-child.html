<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Aaron Chalmers And Talia Mia Announced Their Third Child</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Aaron Chalmers and his girlfriend Talia Mia are having a great time!&nbsp;The couple, who had two children in the previous two years, are unyielding in their desire to have more children. They will now have three in three.&nbsp;Chalmers and Mia revealed in early April 2022 that they were expecting their third child. Their statement also revealed the due date of the infant.</p><h2>Aaron Chalmers and his girlfriend Talia Mia expect a third child.</h2><p>Chalmers and Tia announced the impending birth of their fourth child on their individual Instagram profiles on April 7, 2022. Both posts had the same caption from the Geordie Shore stars. “ANOTHER BABY CHALMERS ON THE WAY,” they revealed as the caption started.&nbsp;The couple couldn’t believe they were expecting another child. They displayed a beautiful blanket produced by Memories By Me!, a customized photo blanket company, in the following photo. “We’re having another baby,” the blanket’s embroidered lettering proclaimed.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Aaron-Chalmers-2.jpg alt="Aaron Chalmers" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The blanket included photos of the complete family, including Chalmers, Mia, and their three children. It also included a photo of their apparently soon-to-be-born baby’s sonogram. They knew what they were doing when they had back-to-back infants, and they admitted it in the post. “Three infants in three years, we must be insane!” they laughed.&nbsp;Chalmers and his fiancée couldn’t wait until September when they’d have three children under the age of three.</p><p>The shot also included their full (very gorgeous) family – their two children were seated on the floor, and their youngest was perched on a baby desk.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, many individuals were aware of Mia’s pregnancy before the couple announced it in April. The Sun claimed on March 28, 2022, that an insider source had disclosed the couple’s pregnancy to them.&nbsp;The informant said she was 16 weeks pregnant at the time and that it was a “high-risk” pregnancy for her due to having children so close together.</p><p>“Talia is particularly concerned about this birth since her past pregnancies haven’t been easy,” the person said. “She is taking medicine to help strengthen her cervix, and the pregnancy is considered high risk. She is getting scans every two weeks.”</p><p>Despite the dangers, the couple was overjoyed to welcome their fourth child.</p><h2>Family of Aaron Chalmers and Talia Mia</h2><p>Chalmers is already the father of three children. After marrying his fiancée, he had two boys, Romeo and Maddox. He also has a stepdaughter, Siennah, with Mia from a prior relationship.&nbsp;Siennah was born on the 17th of October, 2013. Romeo, the couple’s first child, was born on April 10, 2020, and Maddox, their second child, was born on April 18, 2021.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Aaron-Chalmers-3.jpg alt="Aaron Chalmers" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Maddox had to be born at just 33 weeks by emergency C-section because his heart stopped beating shortly before delivery. Mia was hurried to the hospital, and Chalmers arrived late.&nbsp;The family has relocated to Newcastle upon Tyne. Chalmers, who formerly suffered from alcoholism, has now recovered and is now a hands-on parent.&nbsp;They will become a family of six with the birth of their fourth child, the gender of which they do not yet know.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYmqqfo3qktMClpJ6qo2Kur7CMrZiloZFiuqqtjJqlp6elo7CmsIytn56homLBqbXRnWScoJmhsXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./surprising-no-one-julia-louis-dreyfus-had-heaps-of-scenes-cut-from-black-panther-wakanda-forever-for-being-too-funny.html><span>←</span><span>Surprising no one, Julia Louis-Dreyfus had heaps of scenes cut from Black Panther: Wakanda Foreve</span></a>
