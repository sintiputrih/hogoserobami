One Redditor pointed out that in one of Joy-Anna's Instagram stories, she added a 'just peachy' sticker to a photo of herself and Austin with their new baby. The Redditor theorized it could be a clue that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>they named her Georgia</u></a>, as in Georgia peaches.</p><p>Someone pointed out that there is a town by the name of Forsyth in Georgia. And using that name would carry on a "G" letter theme, if that's the plan after their firstborn, Gideon. Given that Joy-Anna's daughter's name is actually Evelyn, however, the "G" theme has effectively been debunked.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>25 weeks!üíù .

Besides Anna and Josh using "M" names, Josiah and Lauren Duggar explained at their baby shower for their daughter Bella that they planned to use a naming theme as well.</p><p>After losing Lauren's first pregnancy early on with a baby who would have been named Asa, they planned to go alphabetically, meaning their next child's name should start with a "C." The jury is still out on what the other adult Duggar siblings plan to do for more baby names, but Joy-Anna and Austin likely have one picked that they are still holding close to their chests.</p><p>Watch Counting On on Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7y6ecCnpZpllKq0qK3RZpmamqlitKq%2By2almqWV</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./janet-guzman-bio-age-affair-instagram-net-worthwiki.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Janet Guzman Bio: Career, Affair, Early Life &amp;amp; Net Worth</span></a>
