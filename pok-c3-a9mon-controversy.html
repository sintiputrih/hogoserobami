Due to the unpredictable “risk-it-all” nature of the activity and the high impressionability of youths, more and more people have voiced their opposition towards allowing minors to partake in gambling and/or gambling-esque activities, with simulated gambling in video games falling under particular scrutiny. As a result, the Pan-European Game Information (<a href=# class=extiw title=wp:PEGI>PEGI</a>) organization implemented stricter guidelines that limited simulated gambling first to older-skewing video games, starting in 2009, then eventually to adult-oriented games, starting in 2020,<a href=#>[1]</a> and all games released in Europe featuring simulated gambling mechanics have been rated accordingly. While such restrictions are absent in other territories, many nations (the United States in particular) perceive gambling mechanics in video games as socially unacceptable, leading to the <i>Pokémon</i> games slowly phasing the concept out from <a href=# title="Generation III">Generation III</a> onwards.</p><p>English releases of <a href=# title="Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Versions">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a> renamed the Gambler Trainer class to <b><a href=# title="PI (Trainer class)">Gamer</a></b> and removed gambling references from their dialogue. The English versions of the <a href=# title="Generation IV">Generation IV</a> games renamed Gamblers once more but to <b><a href=# class=extiw title="wp:Private investigator">PI</a></b>s instead; however, the references to gambling were kept.</p><p>In South Korea, the releases of <a href=# title="Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Versions">Pokémon Diamond, Pearl</a>, and <a href=# title="Pokémon Platinum Version">Platinum</a> replaced the <a href=# title="Slot machine">slot machines</a> in the <a href=# title="Veilstone Game Corner">Veilstone Game Corner</a> with non-playable <a href=# title="Slot machine">game machines</a>. These changes were later copied to the releases of Pokémon Platinum in Europe as a result of changes in the classification standards at <a href=# class=extiw title="wp:Pan European Game Information">PEGI</a>.<a href=#>[2]</a> This change has been greatly criticized by European players, who felt that it completely defeated the purpose and concept of the Game Corner.</p><p>All non-Japanese releases of <a href=# title="Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver Versions">Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver</a> replace the slot machines of the two Game Corners in <a href=# title="Goldenrod City">Goldenrod City</a> and <a href=# title="Celadon City">Celadon City</a> with a new game called <a href=# title="Voltorb Flip">Voltorb Flip</a>. In this minigame, <a href=# title="Coin (Game Corner)">Coins</a> are not wagered against a win or a loss but instead given out for completing a level. While many people find the game to be entertaining, the change removed the ability to buy coins, making Voltorb Flip the only way to obtain them.</p><p>With one exception, all <a href=# title="Core series">core series</a> games since <a href=# title="Pokémon Black and White Versions">Pokémon Black and White</a> have not featured a Game Corner, remakes included. In <a href=# title="Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire">Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire</a>, the <a href=# title="Mauville Game Corner">Mauville Game Corner</a> has been closed down; the owner will instead provide the player with three dolls, originally obtained from an NPC inside the Game Corner.

In <a href=# title="Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl">Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</a>, the <a href=# title="Veilstone Game Corner">Veilstone Game Corner</a> was removed, and is replaced by the Metronome Style Shop, a clothing store that serves as a means for the player character to change outfits and hairstyles; though, a remix of the Veilstone Game Corner’s background music plays in the Style Shop.</p><p>In the <a href=# title="Virtual Console">Virtual Console</a> re-releases of the <a href=# title="Generation I">Generation I</a> and <a href=# title="Generation II">II</a> games, however, the Game Corner was left completely untouched, although the games did receive the higher-than-usual age rating of twelve and up by PEGI (compared to all other contemporary main-series titles, which PEGI gave a rating of seven and up).</p><p>There are other gambling methods that exist in later games, such as the <a href=# title="Pokémon Lottery Corner">Pokémon Lottery Corner</a>, the <a href=# title=Cram-o-matic>Cram-o-matic</a>, and the <a href=# title="Item Printer">Item Printer</a>.

She chiefly compared Jynx to the racist characters in the children's book <i><a href=# class=extiw title="wp:The Story of Little Black Sambo">The Story of Little Black Sambo</a></i>, as well as calling Jynx "a dead ringer for an obese <a href=# class=extiw title="wp:Drag Queen">Drag Queen</a>", and further compared Jynx to <a href=# class=extiw title="wp:Mr. Popo">Mr. Popo</a> of the <a href=# class=extiw title="wp:Dragon Ball">Dragon Ball</a> franchise, another character who is also potentially offensive in his design.</p><p>Weatherford's complaint caused many repercussions in the Pokémon franchise. The sprites of Jynx in the Western releases of <a href=# title="Pokémon Gold and Silver Versions">Pokémon Gold, Silver</a>, and <a href=# title="Pokémon Crystal Version">Crystal</a> were edited, and all episodes featuring Jynx's original design were cut from international airings of the anime, including a sequence depicting Jynx in its original design in <i><a href=# title=AG013>All Things Bright and Beautifly!</a></i>.</p><p>Jynx's design was officially revised by <a href=# title="Game Freak">Game Freak</a> to be purple rather than black, starting with the international releases of <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Pokémon Gold and Silver">Pokémon Gold and Silver</a> and being included in all versions of the games from <a href=# title="Generation III">Generation III</a>-onwards. This change was reflected in later <a href=# title="Core series">core series</a> games, including in Japan and South Korea, beginning with <a href=# title="Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire Versions">Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire</a>, and in the <a href=# title="Pokémon anime">anime</a> starting in <i><a href=# title=AG115>Mean With Envy</a></i>. Jynx has also been recolored in <a href=# title="VIZ Media">VIZ Media</a>'s reissues of <a href=# title="Pokémon Adventures">Pokémon Adventures</a>. Although the manga is colored in black-and-white, Jynx appearing in the manga are recolored as a dark gray rather than a straight black, suggesting that they are purple instead of black. It is also recolored to purple on the back cover of the reissue of <a href=# title="Pokémon Adventures volume 4">Volume 4</a>. Jynx's skin was also recolored to purple when <i>Holiday Hi-Jynx</i> finally saw a re-airing in Japan in 2012; nevertheless, the episode is still banned in the US due to the implications of African American-esque characters being subservient to a powerful white figure. The <a href=# title="Pokémon Pocket Monsters">Pokémon Pocket Monsters</a> manga published between 2005 and 2006 in English by <a href=# title="Chuang Yi">Chuang Yi</a> didn't change her color, and thus her original black design appears.

This theory is mainly based on Jynx's long, straight, blonde hair, a common attribute of ganguro fashion. Another theory is that Jynx is based on the Nordic goddess <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Hel>Hel</a>, who was often depicted as having a face half white-half black and who ruled <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Niflheim>Niflheim</a>, primarily depicted as a land of primordial ice and cold. Some fans say this is supported by Jynx sharing traits with the iconic opera singing "<a href=# class=extiw title="wp:It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings">Fat Lady</a>," who is pop-culturally portrayed dressed as the <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:valkyrie>valkyrie</a> <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Brünnhilde>Brünnhilde</a>.

Similar to Lenora, the mammy is often depicted as a dark-skinned woman who wears a handkerchief on her head and an apron. Because of the similarity, Lenora's artwork was changed, from her wearing the apron to her having it slung over her shoulder like a cape.

PETA claims that the way the Pokémon are "stuffed" into <a href=# title="Poké Ball">Poké Balls</a> is similar to how circus elephants are chained inside railroad carts. Nintendo responded to this by stating, "Nintendo and The Pokémon Company take the inappropriate use of our products and intellectual property seriously."<a href=#>[5]</a> Around the release of <a href=# title="Pokémon X and Y">Pokémon X and Y</a>, PETA released another mock game called <i>Pokémon Red, White, and Blue</i> that features Nintendo's claimed association with <a href=# class=extiw title="wp:McDonald's">McDonald's</a> and also makes fun of the frequent release of sister games.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Religion>Religion</span></h2><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Christianity>Christianity</span></h3><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Satanism>Satanism</span></h4><p>Some <a href=# class=extiw title="wp:Christian fundamentalism">fundamentalist Christian</a> groups have accused Pokémon as being linked to <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Satanism>Satanism</a>.

Geller, who is Jewish, additionally argued that Kadabra's design is <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Antisemitism>antisemitic</a> due to the five-pointed star on its forehead and the lightning bolts resembling the logo of the <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Waffen-SS>Waffen-SS</a>.<a href=#>[91]</a> He is quoted as saying "Nintendo turned me into an evil, occult Pokémon character.

According to Geller, the store manager "rushed out from his office continuously bowing," followed by "hundreds of children [thrusting] Pokemon cards at him to autograph while chanting what sounded like Uri Geller."<a href=#>[93]</a></p><p>In December 1999, he told news outlets that he was planning to sue Nintendo. Geller retained lawyers in Tokyo and the United States, and told news outlets that he was pursuing legal action in "Europe, America, Latin America and Australasia". In the US, his lawyer said they were planning to sue for US$100 million. When reached for comment, Nintendo in Japan told news outlets they had not yet received the lawsuit.<a href=#>[93]</a> Nintendo told news outlets "None of the Pokémon characters is given a name based on the image of any particular person".<a href=#>[94]</a> When VICE investigated the case in 2018, they were unable to find any evidence of Geller ever filing a lawsuit in Japan, although they were unable to contact the Japanese lawyer who Geller had retained.<a href=#>[95]</a></p><p>In November 2000, it was reported that Geller had begun legal action against Nintendo in Los Angeles federal court, for using his likeness (Kadabra) on Pokémon cards without authorization. It was reported that his lawsuit alleged he should receive substantial damages and that Nintendo cease producing cards containing his likeness.<a href=#>[91]</a> When VICE researched the case in 2018, they were only able to find documents filed from 2001 to 2003.<a href=#>[95]</a></p><p>In 2001, Geller, along with Liechtenstein company Sambracal AG (who own the rights to Geller's name and likeness), sued Nintendo, arguing that the use of his likeness in Kadabra violated his rights under California's privacy laws. However, the judge ruled that as he was not a citizen or resident of the United States (he is a citizen of Israel and the United Kingdom who lived in the United Kingdom at the time), he was not eligible for protection under these privacy laws, so he could only sue under privacy laws in the United Kingdom, but no such laws existed that would protect him in this case; that part of the case was dismissed on August 16, 2001, but Geller continued to sue arguing that the cards violated the trademark rights to his own name. In November 2002, a judge dismissed Geller's trademark claims against Nintendo of America, ruling that there was insufficient evidence that Nintendo of America was involved in the distribution of Japanese language Kadabra cards in the United States (since only the Japanese language cards bore a similarity to Geller's name); since the Japanese language cards were only intended to be distributed in Japan, only Japanese trademark law could be applied, but Geller did not own a trademark on his name in Japan. On March 3, 2003, Geller's lawsuit was dismissed by the judge.<a href=#>[95]</a></p><p>Despite Geller losing his lawsuit, it seemed to have a <a href=# class=extiw title="wp:chilling effect">chilling effect</a> on the usage of Kadabra in official Pokémon media.

The only <a href=# title="Abra (Mysterious Treasures 69)">Abra</a> card released between <a href=# title="Skyridge (TCG)">Skyridge</a> and 2023, in <a href=# title="Mysterious Treasures (TCG)">Mysterious Treasures</a>, has an attack that allows it to evolve directly into Alakazam, skipping the Kadabra stage.
