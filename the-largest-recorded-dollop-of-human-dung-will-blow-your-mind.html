Indeed, the manure was found to be infested with Whipworm and Maw-worm eggs, suggesting the Viking often had an upset stomach and other gastrointestinal problems, Atlas Obscura wrote.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/viking-poop-02-1.jpg><p>Today, the log resides in a glass box at the Jorvik Viking Centre where, in 2003, visitors dropped it, breaking it into three pieces.
