But what most people don’t know is that Fayed also owned another apartment in London which was purposely left exactly how it was at the time of his death more than two decades ago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Side-by-side-photos-of-Princess-Diana-and-Dodi-Fayed.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-princess-diana-and-fayed-were-close-to-his-paris-apartment-when-the-crash-occurred>Princess Diana and Fayed were close to his Paris apartment when the crash occurred</h2><p id=par-3_46>After dining at the hotel, Diana and Fayed exited a rear door shortly after midnight as they tried to escape the paparazzi. However, photographers were assembled there as well and when the Mercedes-Benz S-Class limousine driven by Paul pulled away paps on motorcycles gave chase.</p><p id=par-4_18>The limo ended up crashing into a pillar near the entrance of the Pont de l’Alma tunnel.</p><p id=par-5_17>They were only two miles from Fayed’s apartment off the Champs-Elysees, just near the Arc de Triomphe.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fayed’s father left his son’s London apartment exactly the same for two decades</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Photo-of-Princess-Diana-boyfriend-Dodi-Fayed.jpg><p id=par-6_49>After Fayed’s death, his father Egyptian billionaire Mohammed Al-Fayed refused to sell his son’s flat on Park Lane in London. He also wanted it to stay just as Fayed had left it the last time he was alive. So for more than two decades, it was basically untouched.</p><p id=par-7_28>A friend of Al-Fayed’s told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Express</a> that “A cleaner regularly cleans up the flat, but everything must be left exactly how it was when Dodi was living there.”</p><p id=par-8_36>Inside Fayed’s belongings remain including a wall of VHS tapes. There is a portrait of Princess Diana on another wall and the space reportedly still holds signs from the time the pair spent there that summer.</p><p id=par-9_34>Sources have said that before his death on Aug. 30, 2023, Al-Fayed spent 300 days a year sitting beside his son’s grave –which is in a mausoleum on the grounds of his mansion.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The yacht Diana and Fayed vacationed on sank in France</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Princess-Diana-and-Prince-William-are-seen-holidaying-on-the-Al-Fayed-familys-yacht-in-the-summer-of-1997.jpg><p id=par-10_44>Something Al-Fayed did sell when his son died is the yacht that Diana and <a href=#>her two children</a> vacationed on when they took a tour through the Mediterranean.

According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Independent</a>, the vessel sank below the Mediterranean Sea “due to a leak” after it allegedly hit an unidentified object on the French Riviera. The seven passengers onboard at the time were transferred to a life raft and taken back to shore.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9s7XNnJysq12ZtqK6wKxkm6epm7%2Bqsc2dZJ2nlJ56p63YnptmmaCWv7W5xKerZqqVoq6qusSdZK6mpKTCpLTEnWSjraOperit2Gajnp6kYq%2Bmss6rnGagmah6pbHArZ9noKSiuXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./coco-brandolini-d-adda.html><span>←</span><span>Coco Brandolini dAdda</span></a>
