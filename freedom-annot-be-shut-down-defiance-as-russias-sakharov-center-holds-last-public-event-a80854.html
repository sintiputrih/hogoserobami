Freedom is inside a person,” Bakhmin told The Moscow Times at the event, which was formally about the closing of an exhibition on Yelena Bonner, the wife of Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov after whom the center is named.</span></p><p><span>One of those in attendance was Yan Rachinsky, the co-head of Russia’s shuttered Memorial human rights organization that was a joint recipient of the Nobel Prize last year.</span></p><p><span>“It’s a serious loss, not just for the center itself but for Russian society,” he told The Moscow Times.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“But I think it won’t be for long.”</span></p><p><span>Rachinsky was not the only one present at the Sunday event who expressed hope that the Sakharov Center would one day be able to resume its work.</span></p><p><span>Human rights campaigner Yelena Sannikova who read a number of poems including those of Ukrainian poet and Soviet dissident Vasyl Stus said that, while it was a “sad” day, she felt “no sense of tragedy.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.themoscowtimes.com/image/1360/b4/1BD61CFA-AE0B-4912-8B79-A49326D79B49-3503-000002EC0F050802.jpg><p><span>“History shows that hard times always come to an end and intense pressure gives even more strength to resist,” Sannikova, herself a former political prisoner, told The Moscow Times.</span></p><p><span>“There are so many people here which means that everything will be revived one day just like grass grows through new asphalt.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Along with poetry, the event included the performance of songs written by Soviet poet and dissident Alexander Galich and musician Bulat Okudzhava.</span></p><p><span>It ended with a tour of the exhibition dedicated to Bonner, who established the center in 1996.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Formally, the decision to evict the Sakharov Center was a result of the organization’s</span><a href=#><span> designation</span></a><span> as a “foreign agent” in 2014 ("foreign agents" are forbidden by law from receiving state support).&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.themoscowtimes.com/image/1360/f3/F40C8BCF-A097-434A-BA73-C58FB224C22A-3503-000002EC2442CAD1.jpg><p><span>But the Sakharov Center has </span><a href=#><span>said</span></a><span> that the eviction is an attempt to shut down ”independent organizations that defend the public interest.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The premises by the banks of the Yauza River must be fully vacated by April 28.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There are currently no plans to open a new center, according to Bakhmin, and the human rights group’s work will now take place entirely online.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The eviction was an attempt “to suppress the physical manifestation of Sakharov’s ideas of human rights, freedom and peace,” said former Moscow Duma deputy Yulia Galyamina, who attended the final event.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Yet, it is impossible to destroy Sakharov’s ideas by ‘destroying’ a building,” she told The&nbsp; Moscow Times.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“They are in the heads and in the souls of people.”</span></p><h4>… we have a small favor to ask.</h4><p>As you may have heard, The Moscow Times, an independent news source for over 30 years, has been unjustly branded as a "foreign agent" by the Russian government.
