Christian Dumontet, who appeared on <a href=#>Selling Sunset</a> as Christian Richard, was first taken into custody around 2 p.m. on March 19 at the couple’s Los Angeles home. Police later <a href=#>told People</a> that Dumontet “threw a bag containing a glass bottle at the victim, missed the victim, but the object hit the victim’s child causing injury.” Dumontet was arrested on a felony charge of assault with a deadly weapon, and <a href=#>TMZ reported</a> that paramedics transported the couple’s 2-year-old son to a hospital. Quinn then reportedly got an emergency protective order against Dumontet. But he was once again arrested the following day, at 11:40 p.m. in Hollywood, for violating the order.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cluaesw0100113b81qv1olm77@published data-word-count=35>Quinn and Dumontet got married in December 2019 in <a href=#>an extravagant ceremony</a> documented in Selling Sunset.

Allegedly, Dumontet threw several decorative floral arrangements at Quinn. “He narrowly missed hitting me with one of the metal rods, but I was struck by one of boxes he threw,” the order reads. “He then opened a can of Red Bull and threw that across the room as well, making more of a mess … and returned a short time later, and threw dog feces at me, which he pulled out of the trash.” Quinn said he also urinated on the floor.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cluaf86of001r3b81bpwiws42@published data-word-count=64>The following day, Quinn says she and Dumontet argued over the mess made the previous night. She says she “felt the rush of air from an object hurtling towards me and our son,” and that she then “saw broken glass in our son’s hair and on the floor.” Quinn asked their nanny to call the police, and Dumontet was arrested for the first time.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cluafaa1c001s3b8122v0w1uw@published data-word-count=88>In the same filing, Quinn detailed a time she believed Dumontet faked an overdose to “test” her. “I was terrified that [Dumontet] had poisoned and endangered himself. After what felt like an hour of [Dumontet] apparently falling in and out of consciousness and me being terrified, he suddenly appeared sober again and said ‘you passed the test, you really do love me,’” the statement reads. “When I realized that he had faked the whole thing, I became very afraid of [Dumontet], and what else he could potentially do.”</p><span class=anchor-span id=misdemeanors></span><h2 class=title><span class=_christian>Christian </span><span class=_dumontet>Dumontet </span><span class=_charged>Charged </span><span class=_with>With </span><span class=_three>Three </span><span class=_misdemeanors>Misdemeanors</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clvyicf2j000i3b80cp0amrne@published data-word-count=57><strong>May 8, 2024: </strong><a href=#>TMZ</a> reports that Christian Dumontet has been charged with three misdemeanors related to the domestic violence incidents from March.
