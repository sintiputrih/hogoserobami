Real Name And Face<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>@vision is a content creator on TikTok who has never shown his natural face or mentioned his real name on his TikTok account. His anonymity has brought him a lot of attention and many followers.</p><p>TikTok has been an excellent platform for people to openly express themselves and find others with the same interest as you, and the algorithm will help you find similar things to your interest.</p><p>With that said, a lot of people on the platform share the same interest as the TikToker vision since he has over 282k followers.</p><p>When he initially privateed his account, he had over a hundred thousand followers. Still, since his content is now strictly only available to his followers, his follower count seems to have significantly increased.</p><p>Vision has over 29.9 k likes on all his content combined on the platform, but now that he has gone entirely private, there are no clues as to what kind of content he is creating and sharing with his enclosed fanbase.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=account-user-details-of-the-tiktoker></span>Account User Details Of The TikToker<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Vision never really had any information on himself on the platform, to begin with, but his recent act of privatizing his account and content makes it more mysterious and suspicious.</p><p>The account user had a picture of the Illuminati eye as his display picture some time ago, which showed his interest in the mysterious otherworldly things.</p><p>But with the recent events, he has removed his display picture and even changed the username to&nbsp;@user8th31kzbyy.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=vision-%e2%80%93-what-is-the-account-about></span>@vision – What Is The Account About?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>@vision went viral on TikTok after the account started getting featured on other accounts with the title “Things You Shouldn’t Look Up On TikTok.” Most other TikTokers and users on the platform asked why the account was not yet banned.</p><p>So, judging by the comments on these videos, it seems like the account was probably not allowed on the platform since the account recently got banned for a short time.</p><p>Because of the viral videos made on the account about it not being banned yet, the user changed his username and made it private.</p><p>There are some rumors about the account user having relations to the Boeing Aircraft engineer from the 1980s, Kenneth Pinyan, whose dark deeds came to light some time ago.</p><p>However, there have been no confirmations on the connection between the TikToker and the aircraft engineer.</p><p>People are trying to get the TikToker to allow them to follow him so they can check out his content, but it just seems like an elaborate publicity stunt.</p><p>@vision does have a Twitter account, but the account also got suspended for the time being.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yvoKyhn6N6sLqMraCkrJ%2BgeqWx05qgpatdrLJut82ormaZkqTCtXnToZxmrpmnrq150qiaopmcYrqmsMiaZJqbk6TCr8CO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cornelius-smith-jr-marcus-walker.html><span>←</span><span>Scandal Cast: Where Are They Now?</span></a>
