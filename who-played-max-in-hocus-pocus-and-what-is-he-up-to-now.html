Many of its stars returned for a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">long-overdue sequel</a> in 2022, but the kids at the core of its story did not. This makes sense, considering how much they’ve grown up over the last few decades, but seeing Winifred, Sarah, and Mary back on our screens prompted a common question among longtime fans of the story. Just who were the child stars who brought those beloved characters to life, and what are they doing now?</p><h2 id=h-who-played-max-in-hocus-pocus data-injectable=false>Who played Max in Hocus Pocus?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Max_Dani_Hocus_Pocus.jpg><p data-characters=487 data-current-count=787 data-injectable=true>A few vital characters make up the core of the Hocus Pocus story. The trio of child-hungry witches are vital, of course, but the kids they hunt over the course of the movie are just as essential. Max, Allison, Dani, and of course, Thackery Binx skillfully evade the witches’ clutches throughout the course of the movie, and eventually defeat their tormenters. Many of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">stars behind those fan-favorite characters</a> went on to enjoy long careers in front of the camera, but not all.</p><p data-characters=602 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>Take Omri Katz, the child star behind Max Dennison. Katz appeared in the film in his late teens, bringing protective big brother Max to memorable life, but soon pivoted away from acting. He did appear in a few additional projects, post-Hocus Pocus, but by the early 2000s, he was largely absent from the spotlight. After Hocus Pocus, he appeared as a recurring character in The John Larroquette Show before putting out his second TV film, Dallas: J.R. Returns, and tantalizing his fans with a brief stint on both Freaks and Geeks and General Hospital. His final on-screen appearance came about in 2002.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What does he do now?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Omri Katz (@dankster_omz)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=730 data-injectable=true>That leaves <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 20 years</a> of Katz life to be led outside the public eye. While he’ll likely always be recognizable as Max to true fans, Katz moved on with his life a long time ago. Hocus Pocus will always hold a special place in his heart, but Katz is in his late 40s these days. He’s left his child star days far behind, after spending the bulk of his youth — between 1983 and 2002 — in front of the camera.</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>In the years since his departure from the spotlight, Katz has reportedly maintained a friendship with his Hocus Pocus co-stars. They’ve kept in touch, at least occasionally, over the years that now separate them from the 1993 Halloween favorite.</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=607 data-injectable=false>Katz is 47 now, and is thoroughly busy operating his own cannabis company. Located in California, Katz and his partner, Michele Watters, run <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mary Danksters</a>, a “Cannabis Culture and Lifestyle Apparel Company.” He seems to be thriving in his new life, and living by his company motto as he embraces “positivity, herb, and unity.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMqaOasZWZeq6t12agp2WYpLC2v4ypppyto2Kur7CMsJ%2BarF2ewG60xGasqWWkpHqvu9Zo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cm-master-keys-pro-l-white-keyboard-review.html><span>←</span><span>The Cooler Master Master Keys Pro L White Mechanical Keyboard Review</span></a>
