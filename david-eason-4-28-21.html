The custody battle has been quite intense and has mainly focused on Jace’s bad behavior toward his grandmother. Jenelle has also been dealing with&nbsp;<strong>Kasier</strong>‘s baby daddy,&nbsp;<strong>Nathan Griffith</strong>, since he moved closer to the family.</p><p>But now, it looks like things between her husband,&nbsp;<strong>David Eason</strong>, and their daughter, <strong>Ensley</strong>, may not be going so well either! In a new video, David appears to be threatening to hit his youngest daughter because of something she said…</p><img decoding=async width=800 height=417 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Untitled-design-3.png alt="jenelle evans david eason heaDER" image-id=15658948 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=wp-caption-text>Source: MTV; Instagram @j_evans1219</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title"></h4><p>Way back when Jenelle was still on Teen Mom, there was a lot of drama surrounding her husband and his perchance for violence. Although we never really got the truth of what happened, David allegedly killed Jenelle’s dog after he bit their daughter, Ensley.</p><p>Many people were angry about this, mostly because taking a dog out back and dealing with it yourself isn’t really the most humane way of handling the situation. Others were angry because this was just another thing David has done that was less than palatable. But overall, the incident led to the children being temporarily taken away from the family.</p><p>Since then, David has been accused of hitting Kaiser among other problems. Jenelle and David separated in late 2019, but quickly got back together by the beginning of last year. The couple has put up a “stronger than ever” front on social media, but this new video might prove that wrong…</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title"></h4><p>According to <a href=#>The Sun</a>, a video from David’s TikTok Live shows David threatening to smack Ensley after she said he killed baby chicks.</p><p>“Hey, remember you killed a baby chick?” Ensley said in the video as she walked toward a chicken coop. “Don’t kill them again. Then I’ll be so mad.”</p><p>“What?” David can be heard saying. “Girl, you have lost your mind. What are you talking about?”</p><p>“Yesterday, you killed a baby chick,” Ensley replied.</p><p>“Why would you say that?”&nbsp;David asked.</p><p>“Because you did!” Ensley said.</p><h4 class="slide_title cpxi-italic-title"></h4><p>“No I did not,” David then says. “I will smack you in the mouth.”</p><p>Although he denies the incident, there is reason to believe Ensley. Kids usually say what they see, and David has a history of violence toward animals.</p><p>Last year, he killed and ate their pet goat, Elvis. He had raised the goat from birth, but later shared an image of the goat’s severed head in the trash on social media.</p><p>David was also arrested last year for assault with a deadly weapon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmusqpjsLC5jqBmnZmmnrFuscCspqdlZGJ%2FeXmRamY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alan-ali-the-big-transfer-who-helped-tcu-to-the-national-title-game.html><span>←</span><span>Alan Ali, the big transfer who helped TCU to the national title game</span></a>
