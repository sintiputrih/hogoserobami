Prior to his playing "Captain Michael Gallant" Crabbe had hosted a local NYC based children's film wraparound television series <i>The Buster Crabbe Show</i>. The series, which was set against the backdrop of a ranch foreman's bunk house featured Crabbe engaging his viewers in games, stories, craftmaking, hobbies, informational segments, and interviews with guest performers and personalities in between reruns of old movie serials, westerns and comedies. <i>The Buster Crabbe Show</i> was seen weekday evenings on WOR-TV (Channel 9) in New York City from Monday March 12, 1951, to Friday October 3, 1952. The series returned to the NYC airways on WJZ-TV (Channel 7) (now WABC) on Monday September 21, 1953, and was retitled <i>Buster's Buddies!</i>. The WJZ TV version of the series included a studio audience of kids and became more of a kids' variety show. Despite the addition of the studio audience and Crabbe's personality, <i>Buster's Buddies!</i> was not a hit and it was canceled on Friday March 26, 1954.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeSqsC1sdFmmquZkpeybrrErWSwp6KptW6DlHFubQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./olivia-ward-gives-birth-biggest-loser-champ-welcomes-baby-boy-2015148.html><span>←</span><span>Olivia Ward Gives Birth: Biggest Loser Champ Welcomes Baby Boy</span></a>
