The hit BBC drama was a huge success when it aired back in 2019, with <a class=hm-link href=#>season two’s production</a> taking longer than expected due to the pandemic. Now the show is back, there are some major changes in the cast - but what can we expect? Here’s everything we know about World on Fire season two…&nbsp;</p><h3>What will World on Fire season 2 be about?&nbsp;</h3><p id=eiT8M01Qikd data-wc=42><a class=hm-link href=#>With season one&nbsp;</a>looking at the beginning of WWII from Hitler’s invasion of Poland, season two will presumably pick up where things left off; with Harry having reunited with Kasia in Poland, while Lois is raising his baby daughter on her own.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Catch up with World on Fire on BBC iPlayer</figure><p id=e7OCG1HtIkm data-wc=105>The official synopsis for season two gives us some clues, as it reads: "RAF pilots are sent to destroy German bombers prowling the skies above Manchester, with rescue operations underway on the streets below. The true reality of war has arrived in Britain. Telling the story of World War Two through the eyes of ordinary people, following intrepid young heroes fighting for freedom, series two will take viewers from the war-torn streets of Britain deep into Nazi Germany, the resistance within occupied France, and the brutal sands of the North African desert – where troops struggle to adapt to a very different kind of combat."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b6e93fffc6f0-3056887891616741531310876056480244430268136n.jpg><p id=eXk2n87gJlv data-wc=47>From the first-look photos, it appears that Harry and his friend Stan will be sent to North Africa, while Lois has joined the medical service in Manchester.
