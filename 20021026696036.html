The actor had fallen ill in August and was undergoing chemotherapy.</p><p id=e-A9DYplgeKk data-wc=104>Richard revelled in his notorious wild man reputation off-screen, and the critics revelled in his towering on-screen presence. Claiming that being bedridden with TB for 18 months as a child sowed the seeds of his acting ambitions, he came to fame as one of a trio of talented angry young actors on the British stage along with Peter O’ Toole and Albert Finney, and hit the big time playing a young miner who becomes a rugby player in 1963’s <i>This Sporting Life.</i> Other major roles followed for the Limerick-born star and he was crowned King Arthur in the screen adaptation of Camelot in 1967.</p><p id=eZaJREYsY7kc data-wc=28>But for a whole younger generation of movie-goers he’ll be remembered for his role as Professor Albus Dumbledore in the big-screen epic <i>Harry Potter And The Philosopher’s Stone.</i></p><p id=eE1JS6_3DGZu data-wc=48>Richard married and divorced twice but remained great friends with both his ex-wives; their raucous extended family get-togethers at an Irish castle are legendary. After such a colourful life and successful career, Richard, who had just finished shooting the second Harry Potter movie, bows out with few regrets.</p><p id=ef6wu06EDGYb data-wc=64>“Regrets?” he thundered in a HELLO! interview in 1999. “Are you joking? Didn’t I enjoy every mad wonderful moment? I had such fun and truly great times. Look at all I’ve achieved. And what’s more, I didn’t drink to escape anything, but because I loved it and all the fun that went with it or – as we say in Ireland, for the craic.”</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
