Here are some great quotes about homewreckers that focus on adultery and other acts of destruction.</p><p></p><p>“A wife who discomforts you with truth is better than a mistress who massages you with lies.”</p><p>“Adultery is a most conventional way to rise above the conventional.”</p><p>“Adultery is not a crime, it’s an amusement.”</p><p>“But don’t ever forget: adultery is also biblical grounds for forgiveness, healing, and restoration.”</p><p>“Divine open doors are not for the arrogant, adulterers and wasters, they are only meant for the humble that will be wise with the opportunity and blessing that comes from them.”</p><p>“Ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.”</p><p>“Finding out that you are not your lover’s only lover hurts, but not as much as discovering that you are the side chick … or the side dick.”</p><p>“Guilt and no guilt: these were the worst things. The only thing worse than the guilt was the fear of getting caught.”</p><p>“He does something to me, that boy. Every time. It’s his only detriment. He steps on my heart. He makes me cry.”</p><p>“Hearts can break. Yes, hearts can break. Sometimes I think it would be better if we died when they did, but we don’t.”</p><p>“Her only thought was of getting away, as if she were carrying a live grenade from inside the house, so that when it exploded, it would destroy just herself.”</p><p>“I won’t ever leave you, even though you’re always leaving me.”</p><p>“If theft is advantageous to everyone who succeeds at it, and adultery is a good strategy, at least for males, for increasing presence in<br>the gene pool, why do we feel they are wrong?”</p><p>“If you feel that you can solve others problems, then please, work little more on your own problems and solve them first.”</p><p>“In his natural perversion, a man wants to lie with a hooker, wed a virgin, and keep both.”</p><p>“It’s always easier to avoid temptation than to resist it.”</p><p>“Jealousy from a love affair is something even God can admit.”</p><p>“Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won’t either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning.”</p><p>“Life without caution is like a car without brake.”</p><p>“Love, it never dies. It never goes away, it never fades, so long as you hang on to it. Love can make you immortal.”</p><p>“My own feeling is that if adultery is wickedness then so is food. Both make me feel so much better afterward.”</p><p>“Never allow someone to be your priority while allowing yourself to be their option.”</p><p>“Not necessary that every problem has a solution, you have to live with ‘some’ problems..rather than forcing a solution and doing a blunder, live with it. People always have solutions for ‘your’ problems but none for their own.”</p><p>“Once you had put the pieces back together, even though you may look intact, you were never quite the same as you’d been before the fall.”</p><p>“Only a foolish child would go swimming in the river that swallowed his father.”</p><p></p><p>“Perhaps this is what the stories meant when they called somebody heartsick. Your heart and your stomach and your whole insides felt empty and hollow and aching.”</p><p>“So it’s true, when all is said and done, grief is the price we pay for love.”</p><p>“Some women would not cheat, and some would not have cheated, had they each married a man whom they love … or at least like.”</p><p>“Sometimes life has a cruel sense of humor, giving you the thing you always wanted at the worst time possible.”</p><p>“The emotion that can break your heart is sometimes the very one that heals it…”</p><p>“Unlike wealth, fame makes it easier for some men and more difficult for some to sleep around.”</p><p>“We are [God’s] by creation, and again by redemption. He has every right to tell me what to do with my mind and body. I have. I right to do whatever I want with my body.”</p><p>“When her husband recovered, it was to shout abusively at her…. Later, when she reflected on it throughout the tedious courtroom proceedings, she realized this was the moment she had irrevocably determined to divorce her husband.”</p><p>“When they want you in secret they don’t really want you. They want the adventure. Give them one by telling them where they can go.”</p><p>“Women of dignity know when to stop expecting loyalty when he won’t even give you honesty.”</p><p>“You can’t build happiness on someone else’s pain.”</p><p>“You must promise me. You can’t desire the end without desiring the means.’ Ah, but one can, he thought, one can: one can desire the peace of victory without desiring the ravaged towns.”</p><p>Focusing on your own life and happiness of what you want can sometimes lead to the destruction of another. Homewreckers are commonly associated with women that go after and chase involved men.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77ArZyyp5eWe7C%2BxmhqcGWhqry1sdJmn6illay%2Fpq%2FKnqmsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-rasheed-wallace.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened to Rasheed Wallace?</span></a>
