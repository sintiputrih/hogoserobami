By doing so, I can save $500 in airfare, 4 hours of my life standing in line, and $15 for one single milkshake. The challenge was on!&nbsp;<img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DSC_0708ed2.jpg alt="Black Tap Milkshakes Copycat.

They looked complicated and I wasn’t sure how to make all of that sugary goodness stick to the glass. However, I never shrink from a cooking challenge and even though it was a big one, I am happy to report that there was success in the kitchen! Now, we can all go WOW some people.<img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DSC_0620ed4.jpg alt="Black Tap Milkshakes Copycat Recipe.

This is the most ingenious part of it all. Instead of everything being inside the shake,&nbsp;you create a masterpiece on the glass. Start by spreading frosting on the outside on the glass, about 1/3 way down. You can use canned frosting such as Betty Crocker or Pillsbury or make your own. I used canned frosting and it worked like a charm! <img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DSC_0585ed2.jpg alt="Black Tap Milkshakes Copycat Recipe. Salty Sweet Candy Bar Milkshake by Modern Honey." width=3086 height=2349 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><a href=# rel="attachment wp-att-836"><br></a></li><li><strong>Be Creative with your Toppings</strong>. If you want to a whimsical milkshake – go for cotton candy, Sixlet candy pearls, whipped cream, white chocolate covered pretzels, and a colorful lollipop. If you want a chocolate nirvana milkshake – go for M & M’s, Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, Chocolate Covered Pretzels, Hot Fudge, Sugar Daddies or Caramels, and Whipped Cream. The sky is the limit! Once you choose your toppings, begin to lightly press them into the frosting. Then once your masterpiece looks perfect and before you add your milkshake to the glass, set it in the freezer for 3-5 minutes to set the toppings.<img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DSC_0601ed2.jpg alt="Black Tap Milkshake Copycat" width=2719 height=2588 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li><li><strong>Whip up that Ice Cream Shake</strong>. Using vanilla ice cream (or your favorite flavor), milk, and any favorite syrups such as chocolate or strawberry, put them in the blender and whip them up. Once it is ready to go, pull the cold glass out of the freezer and fill it almost to the top with the ice cream.<img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DSC_0617ed2.jpg alt="Black Tap Milkshake Copycat" width=3542 height=3072 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li><li><strong>Go Crazy with the Whipped Cream.</strong> Do NOT hold back in this area. This is another way to give structure to your shake as you add more toppings – so go for sky high whipped cream. Plus who in the world doesn’t love whipped cream?<img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_6235ed2.png alt="Black Tap Milkshake Copycat Recipe by Modern Honey - www.modernhoney.com" width=1080 height=1080 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li><li><strong>Don’t Forget to Over Accessorize</strong>. This is where over accessorizing isn’t a faux pas. This is where your hot fudge, caramel, chocolate covered pretzels, cotton candy and all those glorious toppings come in. Drizzle the sauce on top of the whipped cream and carefully place the toppings on the whipped cream. Place a straw in it and it’s ready to be devoured. Plus you can use that straw to gather the toppings from the side of the glass…you don’t want to miss a morsel!<img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DSC_0645ed5.jpg alt=DSC_0645ed5 width=1080 height=1080 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li><p>Hello, sugar coma.</p><p class=block-pinterest-cta__title>Pin this now to find it later</p><a href=# title="Share on Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=wp-element-button data-postid=830 data-pin-do=none data-social-network=Pinterest data-social-action=Pin data-social-target=https://www.modernhoney.com/black-tap-milkshakes-copycat/>Pin It</a><ul class=wprm-recipe-instructions readability=5.5><li id=wprm-recipe-12936-step-0-0 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=2><p>Spread frosting on outside of glass, going about 1/3 way down.
