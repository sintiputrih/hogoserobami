After it became clear that Renee and Carter were filmed right up to the altar, fans wanted to know why their story didn’t make the show. Especially with only two other <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">couples making it</a> that far, one would think Netflix had a pretty good reason it decided to cut their scenes. But, nope!</p><h2 id=h-renee-publicly-confirmed-she-got-engaged data-injectable=false>Renee publicly confirmed she got engaged</h2><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false>In a new interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">POPSUGAR</a>, Renee finally confirmed that she and Carter got engaged in the pods. She also confirmed that cameras followed them all the way up to the altar, telling the magazine:</p><p>“[Carter and I] did get engaged in the pods, and we were chosen to be followed for the rest of the journey … We were very excited about everything, and things went really well in Mexico as well. We were always very pleasant, funny, happy, and enjoyed each other’s company.”</p><p data-characters=40 data-current-count=40 data-injectable=false>So, did the duo get married?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Renee Poche (@missreneepoche)</a></p></figure><p>“Once we got back to Houston and back to the real world, I started noticing things that I kind of ignored or blew off that were red flags I should have picked up on. And eventually, I did say ‘no’ at the altar.”</p><p data-characters=90 data-current-count=90 data-injectable=false>As it turns out, Renee was just as surprised as fans that her story got cut from the show.</p><h2 id=h-netflix-offered-renee-a-lame-excuse-for-cutting-her-engagement data-injectable=false>Netflix offered Renee a lame excuse for cutting her engagement</h2><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>According to Renee’s interview, Netflix wasn’t straightforward about why it cut her engagement from the show. In fact, it sounds like the streamer told her she’d appear far more than she did.</p><p>“I got a call a couple months before the show aired, in August, to let me know that our story wasn’t going to be a big focus. What I was told was, ‘We’ll just, point blank, say that Carter was awful, and we don’t want you to have to relive that. That’s just not going to be a big focus.’ They also said timing was an issue, so they decided to cut our story. That’s what I was told.”</p><p data-characters=37 data-current-count=37 data-injectable=false>Are you confused? So was Renee.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Renee Poche (@missreneepoche)</a></p></figure><p>“I did ask for clarification because I was so confused at first. My first question was, ‘Wait, the wedding’s not going to be shown?’ She was like, ‘No, no wedding.’ So I kept asking more, and she was like, ‘I think it’s going to be more like, you guys are friends from the pods.’ It was very vague, and I still thought that possibly we were going to be engaged on the show and then kind of cut down from there.”</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=251 data-injectable=false>Imagine her surprise when the show aired, and not only did her engagement get cut, but all of the scenes from Mexico got edited around her and Carter. Renee has speculated some other reasons for Netflix’s decision, but chose not to share them.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-there-s-more-to-renee-and-carter-s-story-than-we-know data-injectable=false>There’s more to Renee and Carter’s story than we know</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>https://www.instagram.com/p/CxjxFbXrd0Y/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==</figure><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=287 data-injectable=false>When asked about what viewers missed from her experience with Carter, Renee referred to their relationship as an “emotional roller coaster.” While there were some ups, she also referred to some “really rough parts, which I will get into, but not right now.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=723 data-injectable=true>Earlier in the interview, she also referred to the men in the pods as a “mess” and a “disaster,” which may reflect her feelings about Carter. Word around the internet is that Carter brought another woman back to their apartment while living together, and threatened producers to unalive himself if they aired his story. Check out the drama unfolding in the comments section of Carter’s last Instagram post!</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>These days, Renee is happily married to someone else who wants nothing to do with her life in the public eye.
