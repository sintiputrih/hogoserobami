The rest of the cast has to do this whole other thing getting ready with the prep and scheduling when they’re in the ER.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Spara plays a hospital engineer in the IT department, while most of her costars play doctors and surgeons.</p><p class=p1>Scroll below for an exclusive look at a day in the&nbsp;<i>Home Again&nbsp;</i>actress’ life with filming<i>&nbsp;The Good Doctor</i>:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwamxjKCmqJxdmbykwM6rqmaokZ60pnnSqZirmV2eu7S1w55kmmWUlsZutc1mpLJlnJ6zpns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./masami-ohno.html><span>←</span><span>Masami Ohno</span></a>
