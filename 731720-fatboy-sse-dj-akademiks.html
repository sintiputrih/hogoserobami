Earlier this week, surveillance footage from what appears to be a nail salon began to circulate, showing the rapper and his wife Tiana Kimbrough getting into a dispute. The two argued when Kimbrough refused to give him a set of keys, and things escalated from there. In the video, viewers see the two struggling over the keys and then Kimbrough's phone, which Fatboy eventually smashed onto the ground.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Allegedly, Fatboy was upset because Kimbrough had appeared in another man's music video. While countless social media users and peers weigh in, Fatboy appears to be unbothered and unapologetic, recently using Blueface's past altercations with partners as a defense. "Blueface, my ni**a at the end of the day. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">That's my brother</a>, that's my ni**a. He be having&nbsp;altercations&nbsp;with his girl all the time,"&nbsp;he explained during a live stream. Now, the rapper has sat down with DJ Akademiks to speak on the situation, claiming that above all, he isn't emotional.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-fatboy-sse-denies-being-a-woman-abuser>Fatboy SSE Denies Being A "Woman Abuser"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As the duo discussed the altercation, DJ Akademiks noted how he reached out to Fatboy when he first saw the news. Fatboy went on to share his side of the story, denying rumors that he's a "woman abuser." He claimed that all he wanted was his key, denying having ever "hit" or "put [his] hands on" Kimbrough. Fatboy continued, insisting that it wasn't his emotions that caused their disagreement. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"I'm not emotional,"</a> he said. "I been through a lot of sh*t, I'm not. And I know what type of person I am, I am a f*cking vicious dog."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Fatboy SSE denying his domestic violence <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">allegations</a>?
