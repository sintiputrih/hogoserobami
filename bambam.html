Countdown’ in 2015. He also appeared in the Korean-Chinese web drama ‘Dream Knight’ that year. A year later, the Thai actor/singer appeared on the variety show “Real Men” as well as on KBS’ “Idol Battle Likes.” The same year, he made a cameo appearance on SBS’s “Don’t Dare to Dream.” That year, he released two studio albums with the band, titled ‘Flight Log: Turbulence’ and ‘Moriagatteyo.’<br>Bhuwakul became a cast member of ‘3 zaps’ in 2017. His band Got7 released their EPs ‘Flight Log: Arrival’ and ‘7 for 7’ the same year. Then, on March 12, 2018, they released their second EP, ‘Eyes on You,’ which included the hit single “One and Only You.” Bhuwakul returned to Thailand for a military draft on April 9, 2018.<h2 class=insta_newpara_desc><span id=Personal_Existence>Personal Existence</span></h2>Kunpimook Kochakorn Bhuwakul and her husband gave birth to Bhuwakul on May 2, 1997, in Bangkok, Thailand.
