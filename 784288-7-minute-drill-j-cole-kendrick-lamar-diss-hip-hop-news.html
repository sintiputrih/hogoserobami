"7 Minute Drill" is not actually that long but is instead a possible reference to lyrical exercises the Dreamville rapper put himself through to continue to improve. According to Genius, these were brought up in The Off-Season documentary. Cole was certainly <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">locked in for "7 Minute Drill"</a> because there are bars o' plenty.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-7-minute-drill-by-j-cole>Listen To "7 Minute Drill" By J. Cole</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Obviously though, everyone is going to talk about how this track is dedicated to responding to K-Dot directly. Honestly, we are here for the chatter because J. Cole has some cold disses for him, as this hip-hop civil war ramps up. "My text flooded with the hunger for a toxic reply / I'm hesitant, I love my brother, but I'm not gonna lie / I'm powered up for real, that s*** would feel like swattin' a fly / Four albums in twelve years, n****, I can divide / S***, if this is what you want, I'm indulgin' in violence." This is just a small taste of what he had teed up for Lamar, so you will have to check out the song for yourself above.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on this brand-new song, "7 Minute Drill," by J.
