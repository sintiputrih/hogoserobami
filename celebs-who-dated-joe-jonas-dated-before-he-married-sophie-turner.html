We know this based on the number of girls he dated before&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sealing the deal with Sophie Turner</a>, who hails from Britain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The pair have been together for four years, which is already longer than any relationship Joe had been in before. He was lucky enough to meet the woman he calls his soulmate. Fans remember the brief romance Joe shared with Taylor Swift - she put him on blast in interviews, revealing how he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dumped her via text</a>. Ouch.</p><p>He also dated Demi Lovato, who - up until recently - was a close friend. Joe said he felt compelled to help his ex with her alcohol and drug addiction after their split. So, who else has the Burnin' Up chart-topper dated? Let's find out.</p><h2 id=demi-lovato><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Demi Lovato</span></h2><p>Demi and Joe’s romance blossomed shortly after they wrapped production on their Disney movie, ‘Camp Rock’, in 2007. Interestingly enough, around the same time that Lovato was seeing the pop star, her former best friend, Selena Gomez, was dating Joe’s brother, Nick Jonas. Demi’s relationship with Joe fizzled out shortly after, but they remained friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Taylor Swift</span></h2><p>Before <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the always-inspiring Taylor Swift</a>&nbsp;became the biggest pop star in the world and dated the likes of Calvin Harris and Harry Styles, she was in a three-month relationship with Joe. We shouldn’t downplay the fact that Tay-Tay was already a superstar at the time, but obviously, once she went pop, her level of success exploded.</p><p>Anyway, it was Joe who ended up calling it quits with Swift, and Taylor wasn't happy about the way that things ended, as previously mentioned.</p><h2 id=aly-michalka><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Aly Michalka</span></h2><p>Remember Aly Michalka? She was part of the sister duo, Aly & AJ, who gained a lot of recognition for their work on Disney Channel. When the girls went on tour with the Jonas Brothers in 2006, it was revealed that Aly was quietly dating Joe - in fact, he was her first kiss. They dated for a year before splitting in 2007.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sophie Turner And Joe Jonas’ Marriage Had A Weird Harry Potter Stipulation</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gigi-hadid><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Gigi Hadid</span></h2><p>One fact that we know for sure is that Joe Jonas has a thing for models. In June 2015, he started dating Gigi Hadid - Yolanda Foster’s daughter - who was Taylor Swift's longtime pal at that point. Apparently, the ‘Shake It Off’ songstress was totally cool about her ex dating Gigi. In the end, though, Taylor had nothing to worry about because the romance only <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lasted for five months</a> anyway.</p><h2 id=camilla-belle><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Camilla Belle</span></h2><p>Soon after Camilla Belle starred in the Jonas Brothers’ music video for ‘Lovebug,’ Joe couldn’t help himself - he had to date his co-star, and he started seeing her shortly after his relationship with Taylor came to an end.</p><p>We wonder what Camilla thought of Joe deciding to split with Taylor Swift via text - was she concerned that it would happen to her, too? Well, we’re not sure if that was the case, but they did break up, after seven months together, in October 2008.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ashley-greene><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Ashley Greene</span></h2><p>A long-distance relationship just isn’t for Joe Jonas, who explained in a 2013 interview with Vulture that his romance with ‘Twilight’ star, Ashley Greene, fell flat purely because of the fact that they lived in separate states. “We were together for almost a year. I was living out in L.A. by myself, and at the end of the day, long-distance didn’t work. It's incredibly difficult." The couple dated between 2010 and 2011.</p><h2 id=juliana-herz><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Juliana Herz</span></h2><p>Another model that was romantically linked to Joe was Juliana Herz, according to E Online. The former couple was once seen having lunch together, with sources claiming that Joe was “not looking for anything serious at this moment, but really enjoys her company and she is a fun girl."</p><p>After a few dates, the pair were never seen together again, implying that their short-lived romance had run its course.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">You Can Have A Cup Of Joe With Joe Jonas… Virtually, Of Course!</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessica-serfaty-rumored><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jessica Serfaty (Rumored)</span></h2><p>Not long after Joe and Gigi went their separate ways, the ‘Burning Up’ hitmaker continued dating a string of models, including ‘America’s Next Top Model’ star, Jessica Serfaty. What confirmed their relationship status was when they reportedly shared a kiss while on vacation in Mammoth Lakes, California. However, just like the other models he dated, Jessica wasn’t around for very long.</p><h2 id=blanda-eggenschwiler><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Blanda Eggenschwiler</span></h2><p>Blanda Eggenschwiler was one of the longest relationships Joe had in his younger days - this romance lasted a whopping two years. Their relationship commenced in fall 2012, and trying to capture these two away from one another was quite difficult for paparazzi, as they were always together. It was never explained why they ended up <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">going their separate ways</a>, but things came to a halt for the two when their split was announced in August 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dulce-maria-rumored><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Dulce Maria (Rumored)</span></h2><p>Mexican singer, Dulce Maria, was first linked to Joe Jonas when they performed together onstage in 2011. It was rumored at the time that the pair remained in touch following their show-stopping performance...and even dated for a short period of time. The reason why Joe probably never publicized the relationship was simply because of how quickly it ended.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sophie Turner And Joe Jonas Put Alex Rodriguez And Jennifer Lopez To Shame</a></span></p><h2 id=brenda-song-rumored><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Brenda Song (Rumored)</span></h2><p>In 2009, Joe was making plenty of headlines after he was photographed with former Disney star, Brenda Song, on multiple occasions. What somewhat confirmed that they were dating was Joe’s revealing interview with New York magazine. He said: "I used to sneak out and hook up with this one girl in her car…</p><p>“The girl was also in the business, and we thought we were screwed because we were both working with Disney. It would have been the worst thing we could think of happening to us. But nothing ever came out!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chelsea-kane-rumored><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Chelsea Kane (Rumored)</span></h2><p>Again, this one was never confirmed, but it was rumored that these two got together during the filming of their Disney show, JONAS. Joe and his onscreen love interest, Chelsea Kane, may well have been romantically involved behind the scenes.</p><p>Joe and Chelsea never addressed the dating rumors, but could that have been because things didn’t end on a good note? We’re not too sure, but the story concerning these two certainly didn’t stop until the show ended in October, 2010.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">16 Pics Of The Jonas Brothers’ Wives Without Any Makeup On</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl8Buw8eoZJ2ZpJqxbrbOnmSjp56WwG6wwK2cnWWSmrOwvsRmn55lnZa%2Fs7XEnWSsp6CdtqZ5066pp52iZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./raven-symone-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Raven Symon Net Worth: Career &amp;amp; Lifestyle</span></a>
