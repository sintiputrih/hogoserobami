Mike who started his wrestling by becoming the heavyweight champion won various championships during his time in the ring including a heavyweight championship of the NWA in Florida.</span></p><p><span>Bray Wyatt’s brother, Taylor Michael Rotunda, is also a more popular wrestler than Bo Dallas.&nbsp;Just as the whole family finds themselves in the world of wrestling, so does Mika Rotunda, Wyatt’s sister.&nbsp;She works as a member of the production team for WrestleMania 33 after starting out as a ring announcer.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Bray Wyatt’s&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>wife</span></strong></h2><p><span>Bray Wyatt has been married since 2012 to Samantha Rotunda.&nbsp;The two met and started dating in college when they were both students at Troy University in Alabama.&nbsp;Their marriage was blessed with two daughters, Kendyl and Cadyn.</span></p><p><span>In April 2017, Samantha Rotunda filed for divorce against her bearded husband claiming that the relationship was irretrievably broken.&nbsp;In her divorce filing, Samantha accused Bray Wyatt of adultery and mischief even as the wrestler denied any wrongdoing.</span></p><p><span>Nonetheless, Samantha went on to claim that Wyatt had an affair with WWE announcer JoJo Offerman.&nbsp;Even after the divorce, it circulated that the wrestler was still reaching out to the advertiser who was on her side in a relationship with fellow wrestler, Jesse White who she had been dating since 2013.</span></p><p><span>After the separation, Samantha Rotunda filed for custody of their children, home, child support and alimony.&nbsp;Alongside the house, she also received a temporary payment of $14,735 from her ex-husband and a payment of $50,000 to take care of her legal expenses.&nbsp;Nonetheless, they are still locked in more battles over paying the monthly fee, as Bray Wyatt was content with only paying $6,000.</span></p><p><span>Since the divorce, it has been reported that while Windham Lawrence Rotunda lived primarily with JoJo Offerman, his wife and children now occupy the family home.&nbsp;This can easily confirm that Offerman and Wyatt are dating.</span></p><h2><strong><span>the size</span></strong></h2><p><span>A dominant figure in the ring, Bray Wyatt has everything for his size and everything that helps him succeed as a wrestler.&nbsp;Here are his body stats:</span></p><p><strong><span>Height:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;6 ft 3 in (1.91 m)</span></p><p><strong><span>Weight:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;285 lbs (129 kg)</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiaopbGbsPYmqutZaees6Z50qKqrZ2iYq%2Bzu9OhnKtllpbBqbHRZp2apZmhxm6txp5koZ2ZnLW1edaioqJn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./polyana-viana-mugging.html><span>←</span><span>Polyana Viana, MMA Fighter, Destroys Would-Be Mugger</span></a>
