The women became bosom buddies almost instantly, according to <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>. Cher was enthralled by Streep, whom she admired greatly. On the first day they met on set, Streep gave the singer a huge hug. "She's all communication and warmth and friendship, with a great sense of humor," Cher explained.</p><p>When Cher won her Oscar in 1988, she was up against her pal Streep, who was nominated for her role in "Ironweed." Streep was thrilled for her former co-star and enthusiastically cheered on her friend during the awards show. In her acceptance speech, Cher said, "I feel so unbelievable that I did my first movie with her, and now I was nominated with her, and I feel really thankful."</p><p>The friends have worked together numerous times through the years. They appeared together for an environmental benefit called "Mothers and Others" and reunited in "Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again!" During the movie's premiere, Cher told Entertainment Tonight that they were still friends after all these years and that Streep was wonderful on their first film together, saying "She was unbelievable, because I had no idea what I was doing."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAkGlqbGlfqbWqusasZLKnpWK6qrPHrWSnp6RiuK%2B71maYm6elqXqktMSrZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marvel-lovers-are-sharing-their-fancasts-for-the-mcus-fantastic-four.html><span>←</span><span>Marvel lovers are sharing their fancasts for the MCUs Fantastic Four</span></a>
