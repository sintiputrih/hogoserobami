Nas rose to prominence in 1994 with the release of “Illmatic”, a debut album that was well-received not only by critics but the audience as well. Referred to as one of the best hip hop artists, Nas has released thirteen albums, many of which enjoyed a top spot on the Billboard charts. However, Nas is not only a musician but a businessman too, as he owns a record label, as well as several retail stores. Nas has a number of valuable assets, including his house in Georgia that amounts to $1 million and a Piguet Splash watch that costs $20,000.</p><h3>Nas Net Worth $17 Million</h3><p>How rich is Nas then? The sources state that Nas’ net worth is estimated to be $17 million. The main source for Nas’ net worth and wealth is his rapping career. Nas was born in 1973, in Brooklyn, New York. Nas attended a high school but dropped out before he went to ninth grade due to the divorce of his parents. Before he became a worldwide success, Nas worked on recording his own songs in a studio, however, none of the tracks were released. Nas’s debut followed soon after. In 1994, he released “Illmatic”, an album that introduced him to a wider audience. The album itself became an iconic masterpiece in the hip hop industry and an opportunity for Nas to gain more exposure. In between releasing album, Nas used to work on collaborations with other artists and has been featured on songs with AZ, <a href=#>Mobb Deep</a>, <a href=#>R. Kelly</a> and <a href=#>Lauryn Hill</a>. He then co-created a hip hop supergroup with AZ, <a href=#>Foxy Brown</a> and Nature called “The Firm”. The group was signed to <a href=#>Dr. Dre</a>’s label called “Aftermath Records”, and in 1997 released their debut album titled “The Album”.</p><p>Unfortunately, the joint project failed to generate the desired public interest and consequently “The Firm” disbanded. Nas then began working on his next album “I Am… Autobiography” and other projects. Nas’ music career consists of thirteen album released so far and a number of Grammy, MTV Video Music, as well as BET Hip Hop Awards nominations and wins. In the meantime of recording songs, Nas has been making appearances on television screens too. In 1998, he debuted in Hype Williams’ film “Belly”, where he starred alongside <a href=#>DMX</a>, <a href=#>Tionne T-Boz Watkins</a> and <a href=#>Method Man</a>. A year later he starred in “In Too Deep”, a crime thriller film directed by Michael Rymer where the main roles were portrayed by <a href=#>LL Cool J</a> and <a href=#>Omar Epps</a>. In addition to the revenue collected from his music and acting career, Nas has been successfully involved in business ventures. He launched his own record label and in 2013 opened a sneaker store called “12AM RUN”. Even though a famous rap artist, actor and an entrepreneur has been facing financial issues related to his unpaid taxes, Nas currently has a net worth of $17 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjsLC5jqeYrGWemsFuw86rq6Fn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jacksepticeye-parents-who-jacksepticeyes-father.html><span>←</span><span>Jacksepticeye Parents; Who is Jacksepticeyes father?</span></a>
