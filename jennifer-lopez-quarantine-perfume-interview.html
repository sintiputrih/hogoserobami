"Even if I’m in sweatpants, the fact that I actually put on something other than pajamas gives me a little boost and then spritzing on Promise, or any other one of my fragrances, helps that energy."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$45; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>ulta.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking of other scents, J.Lo has yet to get bored of any of the many perfumes she's created over the years — and for good reason.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I have created all of my fragrances to be timeless," she says. "Although, each scent was created during different times in my life and how I was feeling at that point, I still always want to be able wear any of them now or in 10 years and have it evoke a feeling."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: JLo Beauty Is Here — And She Gave Us All the Details</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Traditional juice aside, Lopez also loves for her home to smell fragrant as well, admitting that she probably has a candle in every room in her home.
