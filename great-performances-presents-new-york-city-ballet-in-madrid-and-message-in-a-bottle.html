Conceived as an observed ballet lesson, the work begins with a simple tendu and is set music by <strong>Tchaikovsky</strong>. In his later work, “Square Dance,” Balanchine blended the traditions of American folk dance with classical ballet by featuring music by <strong>Vivaldi</strong> and <strong>Correlli</strong>. Balanchine’s famed works are followed by a 2017 piece choreographed by Justin Peck, “The Times Are Racing.” Performed in sneakers and street clothes, the dance is set to an electronic score by two-time Grammy-nominated composer <strong>Dan Deacon</strong>. The choreography takes its inspiration from a variety of dance styles, including references to the tap dancing of Fred Astaire&nbsp;and Gene Kelly.</p><p>The following week, <strong>Great Performances</strong> presents <strong>Message in a Bottle</strong>, featuring the hits of 17-time Grammy-winning artist <strong>Sting</strong> with choreography by three-time Olivier Award nominee <strong>Kate Prince</strong>. The dance-theater production from <strong>London’s Sadler’s Wells Theatre</strong> tells the story of a family forced to leave their homeland and embark on a perilous journey to freedom. With musical arrangements by Alex Lacamoire (Broadway’s “Hamilton,” “Dear Evan Hansen”), and a mix of dance styles performed by Kate Prince’s ZooNation dance company,&nbsp;<strong>Great Performances: Message in a Bottle </strong>relays a quest for humanity and hope. Recorded in August 2022, the show features Sting’s chart-topping hits including “Every Breath You Take,” “Roxanne,” “Walking On The Moon” and more.</p><p>For <strong>Great Performances: New York City Ballet in Madrid, </strong>music is by Peter Ilyitch Tchaikovsky, Arcangelo Corelli, Antonio Vivaldi and Dan Deacon.
