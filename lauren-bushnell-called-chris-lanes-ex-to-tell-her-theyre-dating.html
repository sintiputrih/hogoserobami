However, Bushnell spent time with Lane, 34, sans Antin at Stagecoach in April after his performance.</p><p class=p2>“Once Lauren broke up with Devin, she and Chris went away on a trip together,” adds the insider. “She was on the outs with Devin for a while.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Chris-Lane-Lauren-Bushnell.jpg><p class=p2><i>Us </i>confirmed on Wednesday, November 14, that<a href=#> Lane and Bushnell are dating.</a> The pair sparked romance rumors after attending the BMI Country Music Awards in Nashville on Tuesday, November 13.
