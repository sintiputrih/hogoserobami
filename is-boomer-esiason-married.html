This article delves into the multifaceted life of Boomer Esiason, exploring his football career, advocacy work, and the enduring love story with his wife, Cheryl.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Is-Boomer-Esiason-Married-min-1024x580.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Boomer_Esiason></span><strong>Who Is Boomer Esiason?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Boomer Esiason is a name that resonates in two distinct spheres — the competitive realm of professional football and the compassionate world of cystic fibrosis advocacy. Born Norman Julius Esiason, Boomer achieved stardom as a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) during his 14-season career. Primarily known for his tenure with the Cincinnati Bengals, he also played for the New York Jets and Arizona Cardinals. Boomer’s on-field legacy includes four Pro Bowl selections, winning the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in 1988, and leading the Bengals to two Super Bowl appearances.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Is-Boomer-Esiason-Married-1-1024x580.jpg><p>Beyond the gridiron, Boomer’s life took a meaningful turn with a personal connection to cystic fibrosis. Retiring from football, he channeled his energy into advocacy, becoming a dedicated voice for awareness and research. In 1993, Boomer founded the Boomer Esiason Foundation, an organization that has raised millions to support cystic fibrosis research, patient care, and education. His son Gunnar’s diagnosis with CF fueled Boomer’s passion for the cause, turning a personal challenge into a mission to make a difference.</p><p>Today, Boomer Esiason continues to make a significant impact in the world of sports broadcasting. He serves as a sports analyst for CBS Sports on “The NFL Today” and co-hosts the morning sports radio program “Boomer and Gio” on WFAN in New York. Boomer’s enduring commitment to both the game he loves and the fight against cystic fibrosis showcases a multi-faceted individual whose legacy extends far beyond the football field.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Is-Boomer-Esiason-Married-2-1024x580.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Boomer_Esiason_Married-2></span><strong>Is Boomer Esiason Married?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Is-Boomer-Esiason-Married-3-1024x580.jpg><p>Yes, Boomer Esiason is married.

Their son, Gunnar Esiason, was born in 1991, and they also have a daughter named Sydney.

She has stood by him through his football career, his transition to media, and their joint commitment to philanthropy.
