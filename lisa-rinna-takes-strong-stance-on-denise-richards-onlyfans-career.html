During a recent episode of "<a href=#>Watch What Happens Live</a>," Lisa Rinna opened up about her thoughts on Richards joining OnlyFans and fans may be shocked to hear her response. When asked by host Andy Cohen, Rinna replied, "I think it's fabulous. Make money, baby! Make money! She's going to make more money than she did on the show. I mean, c'mon." Cohen, however, did not bring up Richards making an account on the platform after her own daughter, Sami Sheen, joined it.</p><p dir=ltr>There was a rift in Rinna and Richards' friendship while filming Season 10 of "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" after Rinna asked Richards if she had an affair with another housewife, Brandi Glanville. Richards has consistently denied that she ever hooked up with Glanville, although Rinna and other housewives never seemed to believe her. Eventually, Rinna apologized to Richards for pressing her on the subject and even leaked the apology texts, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>Page Six</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>Richards accepted the apology and told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;that it meant a lot to her, but it doesn't appear that the duo has completely mended their friendship. They might not follow each other on Instagram, but Rinna's support of Richards from a distance shows that they are at least cordial at this time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcm1ibYBze8uiqpplop67r62MrZiknaNiwLW%2BzqeeZquklruksYyopWaclaO2tLGMq6CcoJGnsbR5zqejsp6Ro8Bur8CrnJ6qXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lauren-conrad-throws-the-perfect-party-sneak-peek-w460864.html><span>←</span><span>Lauren Conrad Throws the Perfect Party: Sneak Peek</span></a>
