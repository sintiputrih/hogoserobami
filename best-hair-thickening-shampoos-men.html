Us Weekly has affiliate partnerships so we may receive compensation for some links to products and services.</i></p><p>Reviewed by <strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dr. Diana Rangaves, PharmD</a></strong></p><p>Thin, lifeless hair is a major concern for many men. Whether you’ve always had hair that lacks volume or you’ve recently experienced an increase in thinning, there are steps you can take to revive your strands – and it all starts in the shower. In order to help you transform your locks and achieve the dense hair of your dreams, we’ve created the definitive list of the best hair-thickening shampoos for men.</p><h2>How to Pick a Thickening Shampoo</h2><p>When picking out a thickening shampoo, the most important factor to consider is the quality and effectiveness of the ingredients. The best thickening ingredients include biotin, niacinamide, amino acids, keratin, peptides and collagen. Many high-performance ingredients nourish the follicles to support the growth of strong, healthy hair. Ingredients to look for include jojoba oil, saw palmetto, castor oil, argan oil, caffeine and avocado oil.</p><p>Many essential oils are excellent at stimulating growth, including rosemary and peppermint oils. If this feels overwhelming, don’t worry – all of our recommendations below are made with quality ingredients that will help you achieve fuller hair.</p><p>You should also consider the ingredients you’ll want to avoid. We recommend sticking with clean, nature-powered formulas that effectively nourish and cleanse without aggravating the scalp or drying out the hair. We also suggest using sulfate-free shampoos, as sulfates can strip away the hair’s natural moisture and nutrients and aggravate the scalp. This can be particularly problematic for fine and thinning hair.</p><p>As you peruse this list, it’s important to keep your budget in mind. Thickening shampoos only work if you use them consistently. That means you don’t want to pick a product that feels too precious to use every time you wash your hair. Keep your budget in mind as you shop around, and avoid reaching for anything that feels too pricey.</p><h2>Additional Tips: How to Thicken Hair</h2><p>In addition to using a thickening shampoo, there are steps you can take to support overall hair health and promote the growth of strong, thick hair. Here are a few tips and tricks to achieve and maintain denser hair:</p><ul><li><strong>Take a Look at Your Diet</strong>: Hair health starts from within, so you’ll want to make sure you’re eating the best foods for supporting growth and strength. Foods rich in vitamins, minerals, proteins and fatty acids that are particularly great for hair health include spinach, avocados, sweet potatoes, nuts, seeds, beans, eggs and fatty fish (like salmon and herring).</li><li><strong>Avoid Over-Washing</strong>: Plenty of men wash their hair every time they jump in the shower. Unfortunately, even if you’re using a high-quality shampoo, doing so can do more harm than good. Overwashing can dry out the strands and irritate the scalp, which can lead to weaker, thinner hair over time. Limit your hair-washing routine to approximately two to three times a week. This will keep your hair feeling fresh without harming your strands.</li><li><strong>Don’t Skip Conditioner</strong>: Many men don’t bother with conditioner, but skipping this step can do harm to your hair. Conditioners rehydrate and nurture the hair after the shampooing process. If you don’t use a conditioner, your hair can become weak and dehydrated, and prone to breakage and thinning.</li><li><strong>Try Scalp Massages</strong>: Want to promote the growth of strong, thick hair without spending any money? We recommend adding regular scalp massages to your grooming routine. Scalp massages stimulate blood flow, which helps bring oxygen and nutrients to the follicles. This can help with hair growth and overall scalp and hair health.</li><li><strong>Add a Topical Oil or Serum to Your Routine</strong>: In order to get the best results, we recommend adding an oil or serum targeted toward strengthening and growth to your hair-care routine. These products are made with ingredients that stimulate growth and nourish the follicles to achieve denser, thicker hair over time.</li><li><strong>Discuss Nutritional Deficiencies With Your Doctor</strong>: Nutritional deficiencies can majorly affect hair thinning and weakness. Make an appointment with a medical professional to see if you have any deficiencies that may be affecting hair health, and to discuss adding supplements to your routine or adjusting your diet.</li></ul><h2>The Best Hair Thickening Shampoos for Men</h2><p>Ready to find your perfect match?
