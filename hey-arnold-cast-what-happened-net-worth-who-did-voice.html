However, that doesn’t mean that Disney is the only behemoth in the family entertainment business since Nickelodeon has been producing popular kids’ movies and shows for decades. For example, over the last 30 years, <a href=#>Nickelodeon has aired many beloved shows</a> that have passed the test of time, including Hey Arnold!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After originally airing from 1996 until 2006, Hey Arnold!’s original run came to an end. However, even though a lot of <a href=#>people believe Nickelodeon messed up Hey Arnold!</a>, the show has continued to have lots of fans who want to know everything they can about the show and its cast. For example, many Hey Arnold! fans are interested in how much money all of the show’s stars are worth today.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Secrets You Never Knew About Nickelodeon's Hey Arnold!</a></span></p><h2 id=lane-toran-arnold-in-season-1-ndash-net-worth-s300-000><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Lane Toran (Arnold In Season 1) – Net Worth: S300,000</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On websites like Wikipedia and IMDb, Lane Toran is listed under several names including Lane Toran Caudell and Toran Caudell. However, no matter what people call Toran, it is clear that he is a notable part of children’s entertainment history. After all, Toran voiced King Bob in Disney’s Recess and he was the one who portrayed Arnold Shortman in Hey Arnold!’s first season. On top of that, Toran also voiced several characters in 2017’s Hey Arnold!: The Jungle Movie which is a cool way to pay tribute to his role in the show’s legacy. According to networthwikibio.org, all of those roles were allowed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Toran to amass a $300,000 fortune</a>.</p><h2 id=mason-vale-cotton-arnold-in-the-jungle-movie-ndash-net-worth-500-000><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Mason Vale Cotton (Arnold In The Jungle Movie) – Net Worth: $500,000</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Mason Vale Cotton was just a child, he has enjoyed a great deal of success as an actor. After first garnering attention as a little child when he appeared in 54 episodes of Desperate Housewives as M.J. Delfino, Cotton went on to star in Mad Men as Bobby Draper. While Bobby was the least focused on member of the Draper family, it still is impressive that Cotton is a part of Mad Men’s legacy. Sadly, Hey Arnold! fans who only watched the show never got to hear Cotton voice the show’s main character Arnold Shortman. After all, Cotton only voiced Arnold in Hey Arnold: The Jungle Movie but according to richcelebrities.net, that role helped the child actor amass a $500,000 net worth.</p><h2 id=spencer-klein-arnold-in-hey-arnold-the-movie-ndash-net-worth-850-000><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Spencer Klein (Arnold In Hey Arnold: The Movie) – Net Worth: $850,000</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to most animated shows, their main characters were played by the same actors throughout their entire run. Amazingly enough, however, Hey Arnold!’s main character Arnold Shortman was played by multiple actors over the years. Putting aside Rusty Flood and Alex D. Linz, both of whom only voiced Arnold a couple of times, season 5 and Hey Arnold: The Movie star Spencer Klein is the least wealthy actor to play the character. That said, he is still fine for himself as according to networthwikibio.org, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Klein is worth $850,000</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is The True Origin Of Nickelodeon's 'Hey, Arnold!'</a></span></p><h2 id=francesca-marie-smith-helga-ndash-net-worth-1-6-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Francesca Marie Smith (Helga) – Net Worth: 1.6 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before Francesca Marie Smith began starring in Hey Arnold! as Helga Pataki, she landed roles in popular shows like Blossom and the Drew Carey Show. On top of that, Smith also voiced characters in movies like A Bug’s Life and The Prince of Egypt. However, throughout Smith’s career, the only time she headlined a successful film or show is when she starred in Hey Arnold! Of course, Hey Arnold! was a massive success so it netted Smith a lot of money. In fact, Smith is still in a very healthy financial position since according to networthwikibio.org since she is worth $1.6 million. That figure is all the more interesting since Smith mostly gave up acting years ago.</p><h2 id=jamil-walker-smith-gerald-ndash-net-worth-2-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jamil Walker Smith (Gerald) – Net Worth: $2 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For longtime Nickelodeon fans, Jamil Walker Smith will always be best known for starring in Hey Arnold! as Gerald Johanssen. However, sci-fi fans may also know Smith as one of the stars of the series Stargate Universe and he also has some soap opera bona fides due to his past role in the show General Hospital. On top of all those starring roles, Smith also memorably had recurring roles in shows like Sister, Sister and Waynehead. As a result of his lengthy filmography, Smith is worth $2 million according to idolnetworth.com.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sister, Sister: Everything Tia & Tamera Have Been Up To Since The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=dan-castellaneta-arnold-39-s-grandpa-ndash-net-worth-85-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Dan Castellaneta (Arnold's Grandpa) – Net Worth: $85 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the fact that there are so many Hey Arnold! characters, this list has mostly been limited to actors who portrayed the show’s main three characters, Arnold, Helga, and Gerald. However, since Dan Castellaneta is a legend and his voice could be heard in 75 episodes of the show, it makes sense to make an exception for him. Best known for voicing many beloved The Simpsons characters including Homer, Castellaneta also lent his vocal talents to Arnold’s grandpa. Largely due to the massive contracts that he and his Simpsons co-stars have fought for, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Castellaneta is worth $85 million</a> according to celebritynetworth.com. Unsurprisingly, that gives him the top spot on this list by a very comfortable margin.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Dan Castellaneta Is More Than Just Homer Simpson</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnrFdlr%2Bvu8udZJyZo6l6uLTArWShmaClsq%2Bxw2alnqxdrLyzwMdmrqGnXZm2pXnVqKCcnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./freddy-harteis.html><span>←</span><span>Freddy Harteis</span></a>
