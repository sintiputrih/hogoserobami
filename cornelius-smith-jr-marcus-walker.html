She earned two Emmy nominations as well as one Golden Globe nod for the part.</p><p>“It was a really coveted role,” she recalled in July 2020 when <a href=#>the cast reunited for charity</a>. “There hadn’t been a Black actress as the lead of a network drama in almost 40 years, so Shonda really saw every Black actress between the age of, like, 18 to 74 at this point.”</p><p>The New York native continued, “It was actually this very powerful moment for Black women in Hollywood because … we knew how special this was. We knew that none of us had seen a role like this in our lifetime — and for us — and so there was really a sense of, like, ‘May the best woman win, and whoever gets it, we will all have her back.’”</p><p>Similarly, Rhimes spoke about how Washington toplining a broadcast drama impacted TV going forward.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Now, it feels very normal and obvious that women of color can lead shows. So hopefully that is something that Scandal has done,” she said in a press conference in 2018, per <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “Hopefully we’ve created a world in which we’ve stopped seeing these characters on television and it’s a magical anomaly that they’re there and there’s an otherness to them … Hopefully we’ve made a dent in that.”</p><p>Despite the show’s success, the TV mogul has <a href=#>shut down all possibility that she would ever revisit the series</a> after it ended. “Scandal is finished,” the Grey’s Anatomy creator tweeted in 2018. “<a href=#>I love everybody and would work with everybody again</a> in a heartbeat, but Scandal is finished.”</p><p>Scroll down to see what the cast of Scandal is up to now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BosKK6w5qjZpuRqMFuw8eeqZ5lkaeybsDHnrBmpp%2BsfKS70aecpaGlqHq0ucitn2aiomK6or7Crqpmr5GhuKa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nadine-ellis-net-worth-172155.html><span>←</span><span>Nadine Ellis Net Worth</span></a>
