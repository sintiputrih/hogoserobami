Best known for her work in the reality TV series, Duck Dynasty, Bella looked the most likely to make acting a full-time job. Apart from her work on the family reality TV series, Bella also played the part of Anna in the drama, I’m Not Ashamed. At just 22 years of age, it is safe to say that Bella is still trying to find her way into the industry. But for all her reality TV appearances, not much is known about Bella. In this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Bella Robertson.</p><p><strong>Bella Robertson, also known as Bella Mayo, is a reality TV star, actress and social media influencer. She was born on September 16, 2002, in West Monroe, Louisiana, as the youngest daughter of Willie and Korie Robertson, who are famous for their reality TV show Duck Dynasty and their multimillion-dollar duck call business Duck Commander.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Bella-Robertson.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life and Education:</h2><p>Bella Chrysanne Robertson spent most of her early life in the family home in Louisiana. As the youngest child of the family, Bella had a lot to look up to and enjoyed her early life on the family farm alongside her siblings Will, John, Rebecca, Sadie and Rowdy.</p><p>Bella attended Ouachita Christian Academy and graduated in 2020 along with her brother Rowdy. She then enrolled at Liberty University, an online Christian university, where she studied math and health, and PE. She worked at a coffee shop while studying at Liberty University.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Professional career:</h2><p>Everything that is known about Bella comes from her few appearances in the family reality TV show, Duck Dynasty. Given how the series focused mainly on the family business, Bella’s appearances were numbered. But despite the limited screen time, a young Bella was more than enough to make viewers swoon. The series had a run time from 2012 to 2017 and in the 5-years, fans got to see Bella grow up and be a part of the journey. She was often seen playing with her siblings and cousins, helping out with the family business, or joining in on the family’s hunting trips and outdoor adventures. She also shared her faith and values as a devout Christian and a member of the Churches of Christ. Stemming from her popularity with the series, Bella also played the part of Anna in the drama, I’m Not Ashamed. Besides, Bella also took part in the Live Original Tour in 2016.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth:</h2><p>Bella Robertson’s net worth is estimated to be between&nbsp;$500,000 and $3 million&nbsp;as of 2023.&nbsp;Her source of wealth comes from being a reality star and an actress.&nbsp;She is also popular on Instagram, where she has over&nbsp;590k followers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Personal Life</h2><p>Bella met her husband Jacob Mayo through mutual friends in May 2020 and they started dating soon after. They got engaged in November 2020 after six months of dating. Bella announced the news on her Instagram with a black-and-white photo booth snap of herself cuddled up with Jacob. She wrote: “I was thankful for you yesterday, i am thankful for you today, and now i get to be thankful for you for the rest of my life! I am blown away by Gods goodness and grace. @jacobdmayo lets get married!! i love you forever.”</p><p>Bella and Jacob tied the knot on June 5, 2021, at her parents’ Louisiana farm. The wedding was attended by their family and friends, including Bella’s siblings and their spouses. Bella wore two dresses for her big day: a lace gown by Daughters of Simone for the ceremony and a mermaid-style gown by Jane Hill Bridal for the reception. The wedding was captured by photographer Andrew James Abijian. The</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Past affair and boyfriend:</h2><p>Before dating Jacob, Bella <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>looked</a> to have a serious relationship with Lev Bure, who is the son of “Fuller House” actress Candace Cameron Bure. The couple made things official on Instagram via a post in 2018. Lev uploaded a photo of the pair on Instagram with the caption “Major heart eyes…what’s new.” Their families seemed to be fully behind the romance as both Korie and Candace posted regular photos of the pair on their Instagram including the ones from prom. However, for some reason, the two broke up.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Family Incident and COVID:</h2><p>In April 2020, the Robertson family was subjected to a huge scare. A gunman fired a total of 10 shots at the Robertson family home which was occupied by the pair and three of their children. Luckily, no one was hurt and Bella was quick to update her fans and assure them of their safety.<br>In June 2020, Bella fell severely ill and the Robertson family suspected of it being COVID. While news spread around the internet of Bella’s health condition expecting the worst, Korie revealed that Bella’s test came negative and she is on the mend.</p><p>“My baby girl has been sick this week. Thankfully not COVID, we thought it might be, but results came back negative. So thankful! And happily today she’s getting back to herself. I have hated to see her sick, but also gotta admit It was kind of sweet getting to take care of her again.” She wrote on Instagram.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Physical Traits:</h2><p>Bella Robertson is a smart-looking girl with a pretty fashion sense.&nbsp;She has&nbsp;light brown hair&nbsp;and&nbsp;brown eyes.&nbsp;Her&nbsp;height&nbsp;is&nbsp;about 5 ft 5 in&nbsp;or&nbsp;165 cm&nbsp;and her&nbsp;weight&nbsp;is around&nbsp;55 kg&nbsp;or&nbsp;121 lbs.&nbsp;She likes to wear brands like Nike, CK, Gucci, YSL, LV, etc.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qippake6S7zGiZnqSclnqzu8Geqa2rn6N8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-intel-moonshot-division-an-interview-with-dr-richard-uhlig-of-intel-labs.html><span>←</span><span>An Interview with Dr. Richard Uhlig of Intel Labs</span></a>
