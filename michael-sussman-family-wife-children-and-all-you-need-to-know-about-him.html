He started off as a special assistant in the Criminal Division of the US Department of Justice before being promoted to senior counsel. He was an assistant US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, where he concentrated on violent and white-collar crime. From 2005 to September 2021, he was employed at Perkins Coie as a partner in the firm’s privacy and cybersecurity practice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/19142805/106943167-1631824927770-gettyimages-1231072440-US-NEWS-USRUSSIA-HACKING-PROSECUTOR-HC-1024x671.jpeg><p>Michael Sussman was the campaign lawyer for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and became popular after being charged with lying to the FBI after raising the issue about former president Donald Trump’s involvement with the Russians to twist the election where the ex-president referred to that as a hoax, Michael Sussmann has subsequently pleaded not guilty about the case.</p><p>In 2016, after it was revealed that Russia had hacked the Democrats and that ex-president Donald Trump had incited the nation to target Hillary Clinton’s emails, That served as the foundation of the case against Michael Sussmann after cybersecurity analysts found some strange internet data.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/19143018/220531-Michael-Sussmann-ew-1213p-7641f4-1024x538.webp?resize=770%2C405&ssl=1"><p>The data, according to the researchers, could be evidence of a secret communications route using servers belonging to the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, a bank with connections to the Kremlin. The jury didn’t find Michael Sussman guilty after reaching a verdict by not considering their political opinions. Politics “was not a factor,” the jury forewoman, who declined to give her name, said, adding that she believed it had been foolish to bring the case.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/19142718/124794780_tv076077740.jpg><p>Michael Sussman’s wife, Dr. Apple Sussman, is a pediatrician who practices in Bethesda, Maryland, and is a Castle Connolly Top Doctor. Since they got married in 2002, the couple has been together for about 20 years. They tied the knot on September 22, 2002, in Boston. Michael and Apple seem to be keeping their family a secret as there’s nothing about their kids hence we can’t tell for certain if they have children or not.</p><p>Michael Sussman is the son of Judith A. Sussmann and Herbert Sussmann. His father, Herbert, was the owner of Ranger Rugs, a former manufacturer in Adairsville, Georgia, where he worked on sales and design from Old Tappan.
