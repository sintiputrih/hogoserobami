His mother, Lisa Witsken Shelton, was a junior tennis player. Todd Witsken, his maternal uncle, was a professional tennis player herself. Shelton was born in Atlanta, Georgia. This time, Bryan was the coach of Georgia Tech’s women’s tennis team.</p><p>Shelton’s passion for the sport surprises none. His father had an astounding career in tennis, reaching a career-high of 55 and 52 in the world, in the singles and doubles rankings, respectively. The 1994 <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wimbledon Championships</a></strong> saw Bryan Shelton’s deepest run at a Major, where he lost in the fourth round. He won two tour titles in his career.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Five years later, he became the coach of the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets women’s tennis team. He garnered appreciation from the tennis circuit at large. As he led his team to the second round of the <strong>NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association)</strong> tournament in his first year. Bryan won three <strong>ACC (Atlantic Coach Conference) </strong>awards for the best coach of the year and helped the Yellow Jackets win the NCAA championship in 2007 — their first win of such magnitude.</p><p>Related: <a href=#>Was Ben Shelton a football player before turning pro in tennis?</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shelton-s-career-achievements><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sheltons_career_achievements></span><strong>Shelton’s career achievements</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_COM_20230124_0041_40_1065-1024x768.jpg><p>Shelton won the<strong> 2016&nbsp;USTA Junior National Championships&nbsp;</strong>in doubles. His successful endeavor at the 2022 NCAA Division I Tennis Championships earned him the ITA National Player of the Year award. He entered the main draw of the 2022 US Open Championships as a wild card, losing in the first round to Nuno Borges.&nbsp;</p><p>He won his third straight title at the Champaign-Urbana Challenger and became the youngest player in ATP Challenger Tour history to win three titles in as many weeks. He was also the youngest American in the Top 250.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shelton-s-on-court-exploits-have-impressed-one-and-all><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sheltons_on-court_exploits_have_impressed_one_and_all></span>Shelton’s on-court exploits have impressed one and all<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_COM_20230124_0041_39_9744-1024x768.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Shelton</a></strong> has continued his magnificent run at the <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2023 Australian Open</a></strong>, reaching a maiden Slam quarterfinal. Playing only the second major of his budding career, the American defeated fellow countryman J.J. Wolf 6-7, 6-2, 6-7, 7-6, 6-2 to progress to the last eight stages. Interestingly enough, this is Shelton’s first trip abroad as a professional. Before this, he had played all his tennis in the United States and still managed to break into the top 100 in the<strong> ATP rankings</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Ranked No. 89 in the world, Shelton’s return of serve and counterpunching style of play is instrumental to his success. His in-game weapons allow him to outlast his opponents in baseline rallies. Blessed with an accurate serve, Shelton’s incredible performances at the Australian Open have earned him thousands of fans, both in Melbourne and back home.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shelton-s-father-is-integral-to-his-understanding-of-the-sport><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sheltons_father_is_integral_to_his_understanding_of_the_sport></span>Shelton’s father is integral to his understanding of the sport<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_COM_20230124_0041_39_7472-1024x768.jpg><p>In 2012, Bryan joined Florida, accepting the head coaching job with the Florida Gators men’s tennis team.
