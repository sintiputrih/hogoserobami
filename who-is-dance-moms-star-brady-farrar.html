While in Miami, he trains with Stars Dance Studio, where Dance Moms: Miami was filmed. Whether that had a bearing on Brady being cast for Dance Moms remains to be seen.</p><p>Brady Farrar started dancing at the tender age of 5 and his family moved around the country quite a bit during his early childhood. His father is in the military.</p><p>At 14, Brady already has an impressive resume. He won the Hope Award at the prestigious dance competition, Youth America Grand Prix. The Grand Prix is a competition in which many dancers receive scholarships or contracts to exclusive dance schools or companies.</p><p>He has two brothers and he and his mother, Tricia, appear on the show together.</p><p>Thus far, we’re not sure where his Dance Moms journey will take him, but one thing’s for sure – this kid’s got real talent.</p><p>Dance Moms airs Tuesdays at 9/8c on Lifetime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWivmKR6qr%2BMnZinm5ViurC50maqrZmiYq%2BzrcOyZJ%2BZoqeus3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-is-clam-juice-in-grocery-store-2.html><span>←</span><span>Where is clam juice in grocery store</span></a>
