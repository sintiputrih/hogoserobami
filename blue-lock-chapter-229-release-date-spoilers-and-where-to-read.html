Barou, who is known as the king, scored a goal and showed everyone why he deserves that title. He surpassed Isagi and managed to score in a way he didn’t expect. It’s important to mention that Barou didn’t achieve this on his own. Snuffy, another player, was there to support him by holding Noa. He allowed Barou to make his move. In the end, Snuffy wanted Barou to shine and be the king on the field.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-637 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>What to expect in the next chapter</h2><p>In the next Blue Lock chapter, we can expect to see the aftermath of Barou’s goal, and the atmosphere will likely change due to the excitement and celebration. The other players, including Isagi, will be impressed by Barou’s performance, and Snuffy will probably praise him for his achievement.</p><p>As usual, Isagi will go into his thinking phase, trying to figure out what he lacks in the game and how he can improve. He is always striving to become a better player. The referee will announce that the coach’s substitution time is over, indicating that the players cannot make any more changes to the lineup. The next chapter promises to be even more exciting and intriguing as the story unfolds.</p><h2>Where to Read?</h2><p>Chapter 229 of Blue Lock will be available to read in Pocket Shonen Magazine at the aforementioned date and time. For the English translation, fans can visit Comic INRK. Also, avoid reading from pirated websites to support the hard work of manga creators. That’s all you need to know about Blue Lock Chapter 229.</p><p>Read More:&nbsp;<a href=#>Mato Seihei no Slave Chapter 113 Release Date, Spoilers & Where to Read</a></p><p>Get the latest from Sportslumo.com by following us on&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=#>YouTube</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2Ftb%2FLrqSoZpOkunCx0qmmq6yjZK%2BtwcRmo6ibm2Kwqa3PrZyrZWJnhm6%2BxKWcmquVYrGiwMRmqqmnmaGys7%2BMmqWdZaedsrOxjK2mZqqVlrFw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justin-jesso-net-worth-294096.html><span>←</span><span>Justin Jesso Net Worth</span></a>
