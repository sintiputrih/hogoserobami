This can’t f—king happen. This isn’t going to happen, no way.’ And so I left and she was just <a href=#>really persistent</a> — and thank God.”</p><p>Green noted that he wanted to “play the field for a little while” after just ending another relationship. However, when the actress suggested that she would date other people, he figured out his true feelings. “That’s when I realized. I was like, ‘F—k, I must be really into this situation … the thought of that kills me,’” he recounted.</p><p>The&nbsp;Desperate Housewives&nbsp;alum acknowledged in September 2017 the difficulties that come with commitment. “Marriage is hard. It’s work, I think for anyone,” he explained on his “…With Brian Austin Green” podcast. “I think when you get to the point like we have, where you have kids and you’ve been married for a while and [Megan and I have] been together for a long time, it’s — you just <a href=#>take it day by day</a>.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Meanwhile, Green finally cleared up his past with his&nbsp;90210&nbsp;costars during an August 2019 appearance on&nbsp;Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. He claimed that he <a href=#>“got laid” the most of anyone in the cast</a> and went on to reveal that he had a fling with Spelling and dated Thiessen. On the other hand, he confirmed that he never hooked up with <a href=#><strong>Jennie Garth</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Shannen Doherty</strong></a> or <a href=#><strong>Gabrielle Carteris</strong></a>.</p><p>Scroll down to revisit Green’s dating history through the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr7O1wKdkmq2jqbavecarnJ6mo2KxosDIp55moJmowbC%2B2Gaknp%2BRo3qnu9dmrZqmlajAonnMmqmcoZxk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alan-ritchson-cranks-shazam-rumour-mill.html><span>←</span><span>Alan Ritchson Cranks Up The Shazam Rumour Mill</span></a>
