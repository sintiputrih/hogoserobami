He was one of them," the 22-year-old told the publication of how she met her match, adding that she "completely forgot about him" afterward.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"But then I saw that he was dropping music, and I really gravitated toward this one song. Coincidentally he messaged me — and the rest is history."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">When asked if she's in love with her 24-year-old beau, the "Do It" singer replied, "Yes. For sure I am."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Halle made it clear that when it comes to her loved ones, she'll go to any length to protect them. "If you've got a problem with so-and-so, then we've got a problem," she shared. "I'm a fire sign... If I love you and somebody crosses you, it's over. That's been my stance since I was young."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For her part, 24-year-old <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chloe Bailey</a> opened up about her self-love journey. "As much as people think I'm so confident, 80 percent of the time I feel the complete opposite of that," the "Have Mercy" singer admitted. "That's why I put so much of myself into my music."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"That's where I feel like myself and where I belong in this life — whenever I'm onstage. The girl I see and I watch sing back, she intimidates me. I'm like, 'Who the hell is that?"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Elsewhere, the Atlanta-born starlet dished on her upcoming self-titled debut solo album. "It's everything that I've been going through, all the tearing down, people underestimating, telling me I can't do it — all of those things have gone into the music," Chloe revealed.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"The album is me picking myself up and talking myself out of any little place or space that the world has tried to put me in, that people and personal relationships have tried to put me in, and even [doing that to] myself."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Check out more photos from Chloe x Halle's&nbsp;Essence cover shoot below, and tap back in with HNHH later for more pop culture news updates.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Hayley Hynes is the former Weekend Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop, she stepped down after two years in 2024 to pursue other creative opportunities but remains on staff part-time to cover music, gossip, and pop culture news.
