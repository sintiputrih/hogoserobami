Oddly, the sound was only ever heard at night.</p><p>Local station <a href=# rel=noopener>KGW 8</a> reported that the Forest Grove Police Captain, Mike Herbs, said, “There would be a city ordinance violation if somebody was creating a noise like this, that late at night on purpose to annoy people,” but at that point didn’t have “information that would lead us to believe that’s the case.”</p><p>Other residents, such as Paula Lynch, heard the noise multiple times around 10:30 or 11 p.m. and initially suspected it may have been a gas line issue or some sort of fire alarm, but the Forest Grove Fire Department ruled out that possibility.</p><p>Further testing was done by the Department of Forestry nearby, which also discovered no evidence that the sound came from any of their equipment.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Oregon Live</a> also proffered a few residential theories, including the possibility that air might have been trapped in the sewer lines and escaped through manhole covers.</p><p>One concerned member of the community, Andrew Dawes, a physics professor at Pacific University, made a post to the Forest Grove Community Facebook group asking people to drop pins on a map with a note for the date and time they heard the noise in an effort to triangulate it.</p><p>Unfortunately, the map only added to the mystery, as no central point could be determined based on the information given.</p><p>“It’s an alien mother ship or a warning sign of something to come,” Herbs joked. “We feel there’s a logical explanation for it.”</p><p>To this day, however, no logical explanation has been found. Just like the Hum, one of the weirdest noises in history remains a complete mystery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony4scirm56rpGK7sLXSnqpobg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tristan-phipps-parents-carrie-wicks-and-simon-phipps-are-entrepreneurs-who-has-earned-a-great-family-wealth.html><span>←</span><span>Tristan Phipps Parents Carrie Wicks and Simon Phipps Are Entrepreneurs Who Has Earned A Great Family</span></a>
