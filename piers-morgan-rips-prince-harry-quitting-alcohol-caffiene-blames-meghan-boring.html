He's not drinking, he's not having any caffeine," Piers ranted. "He's like a robot."</p><p>A clip of Harry's presentation was aired subsequently, at which Piers laughed profusely. "Yeah Harry really wrote this," Piers scoffed.</p><p>Before starting is speech, Harry walked towards the side of the stage where Meghan was standing out of view and led her to the spotlight, sending the audience in a frenzy.</p><p>While Meghan didn't speak at the gathering, Harry said, "Guys I am with you, and we are with you. Get to work."</p><p>However, Morgan wasn't particularly impressed by the heartwarming moment.
