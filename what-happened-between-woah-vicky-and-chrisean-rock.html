Vicky made it a point to apologize since Chrisean was offended.</p><p>“I don’t have a problem with saying sorry first,” Vicky said. "Like I said, I didn’t come on that show to fight."</p><p>Vicky then explained that Chrisean didn’t accept the apology and accused her of playing scared now that she was being confronted.

I swear on everything, I didn’t mean it like that.”</p><p>Vicky explained that while another young lady on the show believed what she was saying, Chrisean wasn’t going for it. Chrisean then decided to pick up something and throw it at her.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“My emotions were overwhelmed at that point because I thought me and [Chrisean] got along,” Vicky said. “I didn’t know she was going to believe someone she saw on the internet versus asking me."</p><p>Vicky also said that if it wasn’t for the security guards, Chrisean would have attacked her.

Vicky expressed that other folks present could have helped her but they chose not to.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“It was definitely a set-up, though,” Vicky said.</p><p>Additionally, Vicky didn’t go into detail about why she filed charges, we just now know that Vicky has taken the legal route. She also said that she doesn’t care about being called “scary” and “a rat.”</p><p>The post concluded with photos of Vicky’s face with cuts and bruises.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Zeus network founder and CEO Lemuel Plummer has discredited rumors about Chrisean Rock and Woah Vicky’s incident.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All Hip Hop</a>, Zeus founder and CEO Lemuel Plummer is calling cap (aka nonsense) about the rumors of Woah Vicky and Chrisean Rock being physical with one another.</p><p>In now-deleted Instagram story shared by the site, Lemuel claims that the fight never happened on the set of Baddies East.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>“Chrisean Rock has NOT gotten into a physical altercation with ANYONE on set during the filming of Baddies East,” Lemuel wrote per the site. “Anyone claiming otherwise is ALL [cap emoji].”</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn’t help that Chrisean’s ex-boyfriend, rapper Blueface, also spread the rumors, making some folks believe they're true.</p><p>“SMH, I told her not to go on that show. Free my son,” Blueface wrote in a now-deleted tweet.</p><p>Now that Vicky has filed a report with the authorities, it will be interesting to see how things move forward.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnBnquwnZWjeri7wKFkr6GToMZurc2dZJygop7Apq3NZqmom5s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./strawberry-balsamic-crostini.html><span>←</span><span>Strawberry Balsamic Crostini</span></a>
