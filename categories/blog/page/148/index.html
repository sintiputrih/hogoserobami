<a href=../../../../how-much-does-it-cost-to-stucco-a-mobile-home-html.html></a>
Answer
Installing stucco typically costs $6.00 to $9.00 per square foot. The supplies cost around $9.00 for an 80-pound bag of mix, which will cover approximately 25 square feet at 3/8″ thickness. Finishing coat stucco ranges in price from $17.00 to $22.00 per bag, however since the finishing coat is thinner, you will need less bags.
