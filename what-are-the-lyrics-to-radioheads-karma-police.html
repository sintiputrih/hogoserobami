The video shows a car chasing a man on foot from the perspective of the driver. Yorke is in the backseat, portraying an angel or devil figure who vanishes at the end. The man getting chased is wearing a corporate uniform, complete with grey pleated pants and a white button-down.</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true>When the car ultimately catches up to the man, he notices a gas leak and lights a match. The driver is forced to reverse the car but isn’t fast enough, and the vehicle gets torched. According to&nbsp;The Independent, Yorke explained the music video delivers an anti-corporate message:</p><p>“It’s for someone who has to work for a large company. This is a song against bosses. F**k the middle management!”</p><h2 id=h-karma-police-lyrics data-injectable=false>‘Karma Police’ lyrics</h2><p data-characters=96 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>Now the moment you’ve all been waiting for, the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lyrics to “Karma Police.”</a></p><p>“Karma police, arrest this man<br>He talks in maths, he buzzes like a fridge<br>He’s like a detuned radio<br>Karma police, arrest this girl<br>Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill<br>And we have crashed her party</p><p>This is what you’ll get<br>This is what you’ll get<br>This is what you’ll get<br>When you mess with us</p><p>Karma police, I’ve given all I can<br>It’s not enough, I’ve given all I can<br>But we’re still on the payroll</p><p>This is what you’ll get<br>This is what you’ll get<br>This is what you’ll get<br>When you mess with us</p><p>For a minute there<br>I lost myself, I lost myself<br>Phew, for a minute there<br>I lost myself, I lost myself<br>For a minute there<br>I lost myself, I lost myself<br>Phew, for a minute there<br>I lost myself, I lost myself.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46wn5qsXZa%2FpnnToZxmpKmntqS%2FjK2mZqqRmbawtMSam6xlm5a%2Frq2MqaaloZOafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-bad-dancing-choreography.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift's Terrible Dancing Skills Sparked Questions Into How Much Choreography She Actually Rec</span></a>
