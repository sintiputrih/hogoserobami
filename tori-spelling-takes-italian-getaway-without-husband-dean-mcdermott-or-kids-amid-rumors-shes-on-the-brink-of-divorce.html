I feel like people are always telling me about the best places in Europe and I’m always like, ‘Um, I don’t know it. I’m a mom. I work. I don’t do anything.’ And now here I am…”</p><p>Tori, who has lately been <a href=#>compared to Khloe Kardashian</a>, then began to gush about the hotel, describing how it all looks, before saying, “Thank you. We love it here.”</p><p>The Beverly Hills, 90210 alum, who recently revealed she was leaving her children behind “<a href=#>to work on a new project</a>,” is also currently working in Italy and was <a href=#>previously in London</a>.</p><p>Amid all of the traveling and working, Tori’s husband, Dean, has been missing from all of her social media updates.</p><p>Tori shares <a href=#>five kids</a> with <a href=#>Dean</a>– however, the famous couple are speculated to be going through a rough patch in their marriage.</p><h2><strong>THE END OF TORI AND DEAN?</strong></h2><p>Previously, a <a href=#>source exclusively revealed</a> to The Sun that Dean, 54, “wants to file for divorce” but “can’t afford it.”</p><p>The insider continued: “Tori and Dean are totally stuck together right now. Neither of them can afford to go through divorce proceedings.</p><p>“They have five kids and a ton of pets. Their home is always a disaster- it’s just a total mess.”</p><p>The source added at the time: “Right now divorce isn’t on the horizon because they can’t swing it financially. They are in a living nightmare.”</p><p>The actor was also spotted out in <a href=#>Los Angeles</a> without his wedding ring, leading to more fan speculation.</p><h2><strong>WHERE’S DEAN?</strong></h2><p>It also didn’t help that Tori recently welcomed the fall season by showing off some <a href=#>personalized Halloween pumpkins</a> with her and her children’s’ names carved into them, including one that read “The McDermott Family.”</p><p>Fans, however, thought the pumpkin preparations were a dead give away that Tori and Dean have broken up, because his name was not included in the personalized carvings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000683831333.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000668593857.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000657283174.jpg><p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Tori Spelling twins with Khloe Kardashian with new hair and pouty lips</span></p><h3 class=article-boxout__headline>We pay for your stories!</h3><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpKS%2FqnnSqZylpJmjtG7AwKScrGWZqa6ttcCnZKCdpJbEosWMsKCtoJ%2BqwW601KyZmqaUYrGmrc1mpJyclae6sMDTZqarZZuesbR5wKagnWWiqrqwvtJmqqGdo2K8r3nToZxmmqKeu6x5zp9knaGmpL%2BksY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cambridgeshire-roman-crucifixion.html><span>←</span><span>Rare Physical Evidence Of Roman Crucifixion Found In England</span></a>
