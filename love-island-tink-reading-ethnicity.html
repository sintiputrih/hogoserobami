Moreover, Aliayah, the ITV2 celebrity’s true name, is an Indian name.</p><p>Well, Reading is of mixed ethnicity, half English and half Indian.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tink-Reading-religion.jpg><p>She is currently 26 years old and hails from Birmingham, but the details regarding her actual birthdate and birthplace remain unclear at the moment.</p><p>She only recently came to the public’s attention after joining the ITV show Love Island 2023’s Casa Amor newbies; therefore, she is a novice to the spotlight.</p><p>She may eventually reveal the origin and ethnicity of her family after building up a sizable fan base through the program.</p><h2>Tink Reading Parents and Family</h2><p>Going through Tink’s Instagram handle, she appears to have a great set of friends. Her Instagram page is full of pictures from night outs and travel holidays with her pals.</p><p>She is active on the platform as @<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tinkreadingxo</a>, where she has made around 55 posts and gained over 7.6k fan followers. &nbsp;</p><p>Many celebrities use social media handles to show their personal life to their fans. There they post about their parents or siblings or family. However, that is not the case with the reality TV star.</p><p>Tink has not shared any posts related to her family members on any of her social media handles, making her parents’ identifications unclear at the moment. However, her involvement in a respectable career leads us to believe that she comes from a financially secure family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tink-Reading-family.jpg><p>Based on her social media, could she be the only child of her mom and dad, with no siblings? In that case, Love Island cast member Tink seems to like obscuring her family life from public view.</p><p>She has even made it clear that she prefers a partner who is family-oriented and career-focused. From this statement alone, we can assume that she might be close to her father and mother.</p><p>In that case, as long as the individual retains her qualities, ethnicity would not interfere with her relationship.</p><p>Furthermore, it is not a small feat for a person to be part of a huge TV show such as Love Island. So, Tink Reading’s parents and family must also be proud that she is a cast of the show.</p><p>However, these all are speculations, as she has refrained from sharing anything about her family.</p><p><strong>You Might Also Like</strong>: <a href=# rel=bookmark>What Is Juan Ibarra Religion?
