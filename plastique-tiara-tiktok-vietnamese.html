She's gonna file a restraining order against me," Plastique joked. "I love her to pieces, I grew up watching her. ... She's like the <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a> of Vietnam."</p><p>We prompted Plastique to touch on what the response has been like since bringing Vietnamese culture and fashion to TikTok, the Drag Race stage, and the People's Choice Awards.</p><p>"After Drag Race [Season 11], for a little bit, during COVID and everything, I kind of lost a sense of purpose," she relayed. "It wasn't until I traveled to Vietnam and I got to experience firsthand the impact of representation on TV. Because once you see someone of your color and they feel the way you feel, and that hasn't been expressed on TV yet, and that person is doing it in real time, it gives you ‚Äî it validates everything that you are as a human. ...
