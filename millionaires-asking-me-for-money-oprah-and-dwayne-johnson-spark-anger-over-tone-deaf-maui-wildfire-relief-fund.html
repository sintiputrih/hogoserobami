They explained that it was a way to donate to the people of Maui, knowing that the money was going directly to fund people‚Äôs needs and wants. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The foundation was started with ten million dollars of their own money</a>, a number which many people thought was not enough.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true><a title=@therock href=#>@therock</a><p>@Oprah and I are honored to announce the People‚Äôs Fund of Maui, a fund putting money directly in the pockets of those who were affected by the recent wildfires. As we have seen firsthand, the impacts of these wildfires have been devastating, and we‚Äôre here to ensure with 100% guarantee that your donations will go directly into the hands of Lahaina residents. Every adult resident who lives in the affected area and was displaced by the wildfires in Lahaina and Kula is eligible to receive $1200 per month to help them through this period of recovery. All you have to do is go to PeoplesFundofMaui.org to apply. We are honored to start this campaign with $10 million dollars and ask for your help in donating to those who have lost their homes. We thank you in advance for your contribution.

The general consensus labeled it a nice idea, but people felt that the pair could do a lot more with their own money than with the money hundreds of other people would donate.</p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=731 data-injectable=true>One thing in particular that rubbed people the wrong way was the fact that Oprah stated they were inspired by country music legend Dolly Parton, saying that she gives money back to her community. Then Oprah proceeded to ask for other people‚Äôs money to give back to the community. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt Dolly send her own money,‚Äù one viewer even pointed out.</p><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=201 data-injectable=false>After the comment section tore into the millionaire duo, other creators took to their own pages to film TikToks explaining exactly what the issues are with the original video and foundation as a whole.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true><a title=@jrmortimer href=#>@jrmortimer</a><p>Tone deaf af üôÑ <a title=delulu href=#>#delulu</a> <a title=oprah href=#>#oprah</a> <a title=therock href=#>#therock</a> <a title=maui href=#>#maui</a> <a title=mauifire href=#>#mauifire</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - JR Mortimer" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì JR Mortimer</a></figure><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>Jr. Mortimer pointed out that the amount of money that the duo has accumulated would allow them to provide housing for every person affected while barely making a dent in their personal fortune. He went on to say that anyone of their socio-economic status has the power to make significant changes to issues like climate change and homelessness, but instead, they expect the general public to make significant donations.</p><p data-characters=139 data-current-count=139 data-injectable=false>‚ÄúOprah makes $770,000 EVERYDAY,‚Äù one commenter pointed out.
