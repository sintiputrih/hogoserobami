Ross answered the question we’ve all been wondering: whether or not they’re together! He confronted the rumors on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>, and well, we may be more confused now than we were before!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Ross first coyly avoided answering if he and Jaz are Instagram official by asking what “Instagram official even means.” Come on Ross! You grew up with the internet – we know you know&nbsp;what it means! He then talked about how when he and the other actors moved to Vancouver to film the&nbsp;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, they all really bonded. “We would spend every day together,” he said about the group of actors on the show. “Jaz is like my closest friend right now.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“I’m the favorite’s favorite, that’s what we always say,” he added. “Because she’s everyone else’s favorite, but if I’m her favorite, then it’s like, alright cool, I can deal with that.” Okay this totally sounds like someone being a supportive boyfriend, but we’ll wait until actual confirmation before shipping these two.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/Br_gOWSgnM_/</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>As for Jaz, she referenced the whole “favorite” thing on her Instagram birthday post for Ross on Dec. 29, 2018. “Happy Birthday to my favorite,” she said. “I’m really happy you were born. Here’s to many more good chats, belly laughs, and dances in the new year.” That sounds like a fully-dedicated relationship post to us, but now we know that it’s nothing&nbsp;actually official just yet! We’ll keep an eye on these two actors to see if they’ll decide to spill more deets on their status any time soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH1ye5BvZquno6h6rcXNnJ9mnJGptq%2BzjKOYs2WjnrukuMCrZKutnaS%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./geoff-wightman.html><span>←</span><span>Geoff Wightman- Wiki, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Ethnicity, Career</span></a>
