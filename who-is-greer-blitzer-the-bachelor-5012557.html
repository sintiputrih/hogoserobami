What Does Greer Blitzer Do?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Before going on&nbsp;The Bachelor, Greer worked as an account executive at InMode in New York City. Her job was in medical device sales, selling aesthetic biotech to physicians in the northeast, according to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn</a>. Greer was with the company from Dec. 2020 until Aug. 2022, and she began filming in September.

Where Did Greer Blitzer Go To College?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Greer attended the University of Mississippi and graduated with a Bachelors of Business Administration degree in Marketing. She graduated in May 2020 after four years at the university. At the time of her graduation, Greer did not have a job. “I graduated from full time student to full time unemployed,” she wrote on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> in May 2020. “Venmo [username] if you’re looking to help someone in need.” Greer was in the Pi Beta Phi sorority during her time at school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-bachelor-recap-abc-embedd5-2.jpg><h2>3. Where Does Greer Blitzer Live?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Greer currently lives in New York City after “taking a risk” and moving there. She grew up in Houston, Texas. Greer “loves living her life to the fullest” in NYC, according to her ABC bio. She appears to have moved to the Big Apple in the fall of 2020.</p><h2>4. How Old Is Greer Blitzer?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Greer was born on April 14, 1998. She was 24 years old when she filmed&nbsp;The Bachelor in the fall of 2022.</p><h2>5. Greer Blitzer’s Blackface Apology</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>When season 27 of&nbsp;The Bachelor began filming, some of Greer’s old tweets defending someone wearing blackface resurfaced. She took to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> story to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>apologize</a>. “The journey to love is filled with lessons and these lessons are also made on our journey of growth,” Greer wrote. “In my past, I have made some uneducated, ignorant and frankly, wrong, comments on my social media accounts. In particular, I used misguided arguments on Twitter to defend a student who dressed in Blackface as Tupac for Halloween. I am deeply sorry to those I have hurt, especially those within the Black community, not because these screenshots have resurfaced, but because I ever shared these harmful opinions at all. Time and age do not excuse my actions, but this is not a reflection of who I am today.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K0s7HEq2SbpJmpx6a%2BjK2fnmWSlrCpscuoqWZtYGZ%2FdoGWaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stephen-f-lynch-net-worth-57706.html><span>←</span><span>Stephen F.
