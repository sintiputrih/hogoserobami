One day, her husband came to her and told her they would have another baby boy named Jacob.</p><p class=Fg>Mike explained how he'd come to that conclusion after having two miscarriages and contemplating adoption. While <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.iamsecond.com/film/mike-and-carrie/#series-video-421721503>wrestling with his thoughts</a>, the former athlete "sensed" God telling him they would have a son named Jacob.</p><p class=Fg>However, they had their third miscarriage, and Underwood was so frustrated that she confronted her husband, demanding to know where their second son was.

She recalled <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/carrie-underwood-on-getting-beyond-three-miscarriages-to-joy/>saying</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"And I was like, 'You heard me.'

But maybe, I don't know, He heard me."</p><p class=Fg>She asked to see her doctor so they could conclude the pregnancy and move on; however, a nurse told her things were looking great with her fourth pregnancy!

She <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs_U3ooAyrJ/>said</a> their hearts were full, but their eyes were tired, adding:</p><p class=Fg>"Our lives are forever changed.
