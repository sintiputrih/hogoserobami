She started off the 10-minute video by saying, “Some people are saying things about me that just aren’t true."</p><p>She continued, “Even though my team has strongly advised me not to say what I’m going to say, I realized they never said I couldn’t sing about what I want to say.”</p><p style=text-align:start>“I used to message my fans — but not in a creepy way, like a lot of you are trying to suggest." She explained, "It was more of a loser kind of way. I was just trying to be besties with everybody.”</p><p style=text-align:start>Ballinger went on to admit that “There were times in DMs when I would overshare” but said that she ultimately “Changed my behavior and took accountability.”</p><p>Then she started to strum her ukulele and sing. She started with lyrics that said: "Thought you wanted me to take accountability / but that’s not the point of your mob mentality / your goal is to ruin the life of the person you despise / while you dramatize your lies and monetize their demise.”</p><p>She addressed the hate campaign going around on social media trying to slander her name numerous times throughout the song, referring to it as a "toxic gossip train."</p><p style=text-align:start>In the song, she addressed the haters, “I’m sure you’re disappointed in my shitty little song / I know you wanted me to say that I was 100% in the wrong / well I’m sorry I’m not gonna take that route / of admitting to lies and rumors that you made up for clout.”</p><p>“The only thing I’ve ever groomed is my two Persian cats / I’m not a groomer, just a loser / who didn’t understand I shouldn’t respond to fans / and I’m not a predator even a lot of you think so / because five years ago I made a fart joke,” Ballinger denied allegations.</p><p>Allegations against Colleen were first reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC News</a> in 2020, in which YouTuber Adam McIntyre made a video alleging that Ballinger “formed an inappropriate personal friendship with him while he was between the ages of 13 and 16."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What did the memes say?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>colleen ballinger after her team said she couldn’t talk about the grooming allegations🤡 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vtI0AAUthH</a></p>— victor💋 (@arianacuntea) <a href=#>June 28, 2023</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Many made fun of Colleen's apology video, using clips of Ariana Grande as Cat in Victorious for the memes.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>“but didn’t you groom-“</p><p>colleen ballinger: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/jQeFjrt7BX</a></p>— cameron (@cambeserious) <a href=#>June 28, 2023</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Another posted a screenshot of a YouTube comment, roasting Colleen and saying that this apology video wasn't the "All Too Well 10 minute version," shocked that she was acting like she was wronged.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>don’t think anything will beat this comment on colleen ballinger’s video <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/yXkHYFcgsP</a></p>— M Heath (@mkheath14) <a href=#>June 28, 2023</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Other Twitter users poked fun at the fact that Colleen was singing and strumming the ukulele at all.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Colleen Ballinger responding to the internet rn: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/eUGlVBWIxl</a></p>— E_NicS (@Draocht011) <a href=#>June 28, 2023</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>colleen ballinger right now <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/okjzeXtJXQ</a></p>— robyn (taylors version) (@paceinmypen13) <a href=#>June 28, 2023</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>The second-hand embarassment had never been so strong and Colleen's refusal to apologize baffled viewers.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This Colleen Ballinger response video is giving me so much second-hand embarrassment I had to call off sick for the rest of the week. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FsA9BRDtds</a></p>— villette (@pickledspork) <a href=#>June 28, 2023</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>colleen ballinger decided to make a 10 minute song about victimizing herself instead of simply apologizing and taking accountability like a normal person <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HjtjL49Wam</a></p>— amfora (@dilfloverslay) <a href=#>June 28, 2023</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>If there's anything that never changes in this world, it's YouTubers and their unfailing ability to put out perplexing apology videos.
