"Once I find a skincare product that I love the texture and scent of, it's easy to be consistent with using it. I used to see my skincare routine as a chore and rush through it, but now I enjoy the self-care element."</p><p id=e1rtVBgrxE_ data-wc=70>Rachel also credits her dewy skin and glossy hair to <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenersponsored nofollow">Gold Collagen's Hairlift</a></span>, which the mum-of-two says slots easily into her daily routine.

She's also recently joined as a guest presenter, taking to the airwaves for the first time as a host, which was a huge step out of her comfort zone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/92efecbb119f-hello-rachel-stevens-may-2023-shane-taylor-01.jpg><p id=e_5xMwjKJcD data-wc=52>"<strong>My first show on was really out of my comfort zone but I absolutely love it</strong>," Rachel told , lighting up with happiness as she spoke about her latest challenge. "It's such a great way of expressing yourself. Radio presenting is like you're talking to a friend and it's really lovely.</p><p id=e4WTI5_q2To data-wc=16>"It's fun and I love music and I'm really starting to grow in confidence with it."</p><p id=ex7co2CFUz3 data-wc=32>Stepping out of her comfort zone is something that's important to Rachel, who says that given the chance, she is prone to retreating into herself, but knows this isn't good for her.</p><p id=eIzH3_Szmpn data-wc=39>"<strong>I feel so lucky in my career to have the opportunity to always step out of my comfort zone.

I tend to want to hide away, but I've realised that actually I do need to talk things out because I can get very in my head.</p><p id=eZ08EV-hr7v4 data-wc=20>"<strong>Reaching out to someone I really trust and talking and expressing how I'm feeling has been so helpful for me</strong>."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/71fe07cb4193-hello-rachel-stevens-may-2023-shane-taylor-03.jpg><p id=e5-TUHQmQWlK data-wc=22>Speaking openly is something Rachel also encourages in her daughters, Amelie, 12, and Minnie, 9, who she shares with ex-husband Alex Bourne.</p><p id=e0prSBEK1gx7 data-wc=20>"Showing an interest in who they are and hearing them is how I encourage confidence in my daughters," Rachel explained.</p><p id=eXTl12wIWXBr data-wc=54>"Empathising with them and really listening to them is so important. Minnie came out of school upset recently, and naturally as a parent I wanted to protect her and tell her it was okay, but emphasising and telling her she was validated in her feelings diffused the whole situation and she felt totally calm.</p><p id=etTnyfLdPrGa data-wc=19>"I think the more validated children feel, and the more heard they feel is key to confidence," Rachel continued.</p><p id=eyhVJqrmuqnq data-wc=24>"I want to hear their opinions. I want to know what they love, what they don't love, what they just make them feel heard."</p><p id=eDV-xdyRFtEd data-wc=22>Her own confidence has been a work in progress, with Rachel sharing she's had to fake it a lot throughout her career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e47c96b589b2-hello-rachel-stevens-may-2023-shane-taylor-05.jpg><p id=eQ8f4S22eCMR data-wc=45>"<strong>Being famous so young really impacted my confidence</strong>," she confided. "I joined the band when I was 19, and when you're a teenager you're trying to fit in, you're trying to work everything out and I really didn't know who I was at that point.</p><p id=eBibxgQfTzqq data-wc=43>"A lot of the time I had to just switch on a smile. I actually got very good at putting on the show face and pushing down everything that was really going on. I think that's what I really struggled with," she said.</p><p id=e0NZ7STAE8vk data-wc=30>"I honestly think I've felt my most confidence in the last few years, from finding my voice and finding what I really need in my life and setting those boundaries.</p><p id=eSVvUFlj5Nqw data-wc=49>"I've done so much growing in the last few years, more than any time in my life, but still, feeling confident is a work in progress. One day I feel confident and the next day I don't, it's so changeable all the time. I'm just constantly figuring it out."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e6f39483fbda-hello-rachel-stevens-may-2023-shane-taylor-06.jpg><p id=eq7GOV9KIfjn data-wc=19>One thing Rachel has figured out is that when she's feeling down, it's time to step away from Instagram.</p><p id=edopy3ZKQURf data-wc=36>"We're drawn to social media when we're feeling low or down, and then you see everyone's highlights, and I've realised I need to say to myself, 'This isn't making me feel good,' and take a break."</p><p id=eYCmNn4bCoWb data-wc=40>That said, Rachel has a devoted following on social media, who love her petite fashion recommendations and flawless, minimalist vibe. "Style is an expression and I've always loved that," she said. "I love the way it can give you confidence.</p><p id=e76H1Nk0ym_6 data-wc=30>"It's like putting on your armour but it's also fun. Fashion is creative, it's an expression of who you are and I love to connect with my followers that way."</p><p id=eKbw8v89POoN data-wc=44>With the tour months away, and exciting projects on the horizon, we can't wait to see how Rachel will step out of her comfort zone next.
