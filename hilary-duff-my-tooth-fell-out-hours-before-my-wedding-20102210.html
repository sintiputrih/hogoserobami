"Tooth fell out in my hand. Thank god I didn't swallow it. Not good for a bride on her wedding day."</p><p>The actress, singer and author explains how it happened. "I bit into a bagel. I was sitting on the bed with my mom and my sister and they're like 'You're an idiot, you did not. Come on!'"</p><p>The catastrophe happened around 11 a.m., and the bride was scheduled to begin primping in three hours. "I had a little cushion time," Duff says.</p><p>"I started laughing at myself and then I really burst into tears," the star admits. The dental emergency was solved in time, however, by someone close to her wedding planner, Mindy Weiss.</p><p>"Mindy's sister's husband best friend is a top dentist in Montecito and she called him up," Duff explains.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"The actual wedding was perfect," she gushes. Indeed, she and Comrie, 29, had a stunning sunset ceremony at a $29 million estate near the San Ysidro Ranch in Montecito, Calif. as 100 friends and family looked on. Duff wore a strapless Vera Wang gown.</p><p>"It was one of the most beautiful weddings I've ever seen," a guest told <strong>Us</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX522ra3RsmSdrZabeq7FjK2mqKyYYrOmuMtmpq6sXZ28tr7SZpmenp%2Bnsm652GaunpyUnruoeZFpaGlqYmZ9cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./clara-wilsey.html><span>←</span><span>Clara Wilsey: Rising Star in Modeling and Acting</span></a>
