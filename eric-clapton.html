Eric Clapton Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴&nbsp;&nbsp;Line by Line Meaning ↴I don't care if you never come home
I don't mind if you just keep on rowin' away on a distant sea
'Cause I don't love you and you don't love meYou cause a commotion when you come to town
You give 'em a smile and they melt
And your lovers and friends is all good and fine"><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The singer declares that he doesn't care if his partner never comes home or leaves town, as their love for each other has died. The relationship has become toxic and both parties have become indifferent towards each other. However, despite this, they are still bound by the promises they made and try to keep up appearances for the sake of their friends and family.</p><br><p>The verse "You cause a commotion when you come to town, You give 'em a smile and they melt" highlights the social appeal of the partner, and how they have the power to charm those around them. This can make it difficult for the singer to move on, as they constantly see others fall for the allure of their partner. The chorus "La la la la la la" is a reflection of the emotional numbing experienced when a relationship has ended.</p><br><p>The bridge "I tried to love for years upon years, You refuse to take me for real" depicts the singer's frustration and desperation to salvage the relationship, but their partner remained emotionally distant. The final plea "I'd still love you if you'd just love me" shows how broken the singer is and how much they still yearn for their partner's love, despite the toxicity of their relationship.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>I don't care if you never come home</u><br>I have no emotional attachment to you whatsoever.</p><br><p><u>I don't mind if you just keep on rowin' away on a distant sea</u><br>You can go ahead and leave because it doesn't make any difference to me.</p><br><p><u>'Cause I don't love you and you don't love me</u><br>There is no love between us.</p><br><p><u>You cause a commotion when you come to town</u><br>You attract a lot of attention when you're around.</p><br><p><u>You give 'em a smile and they melt</u><br>Your smile has a mesmerizing effect on people.</p><br><p><u>And your lovers and friends is all good and fine</u><br>Your romantic and platonic relationships are not my concern.</p><br><p><u>But I don't like yours and you don't like mine</u><br>We have no interest in each other's partners or friends.</p><br><p><u>I don't care what you do at night</u><br>Your activities at night are none of my business.</p><br><p><u>Oh, I don't care how you get you delites</u><br>I am indifferent to your methods of obtaining pleasure.</p><br><p><u>We'll leave it alone and just let it be</u><br>It's better to avoid discussing our personal lives.</p><br><p><u>I don't love you and you don't love me</u><br>Our relationship lacks any love or affection.</p><br><p><u>I got a problem, can you relate</u><br>I'm facing an issue, can you empathize?</p><br><p><u>I got a woman callin' love hate</u><br>I'm in a complicated relationship where love and hate coexist.</p><br><p><u>We made a vow we'd always be friends</u><br>We promised to remain friends no matter what.</p><br><p><u>How could we know that promises end</u><br>We never anticipated that our friendship would come to an end.</p><br><p><u>I tried to love for years upon years</u><br>I made numerous attempts to love you throughout the years.</p><br><p><u>You refuse to take me for real</u><br>You never took my feelings seriously.</p><br><p><u>It's time you saw what I want you to see</u><br>I want you to understand my perspective on our relationship.</p><br><p><u>I'd still love you if you'd just love me</u><br>I'm willing to love you only if you reciprocate that love.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © BMG Rights Management, Universal Music Publishing Group, Spirit Music Group, Songtrust Ave<br>Written by: BRANDON CASEY, BRANDON D CASEY, BRIAN CASEY, BRIAN D CASEY, BRYAN MICHAEL PAUL COX, JERMAINE DUPRI, GARY SMITH, BERT YOUNG</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maH2inrCgj8uap62nnmSds7vMoqqeqw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=next href=./fallout-shady-sands-explained.html><span>Fallout: Shady Sands, explained</span><span>→</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class=footer><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=./></a></p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Hugo️️</a>️</p></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
