She inherited a stake in Koch Industries, which is believed to be around 15%, following the death of her husband, E. Pierce Marshall. Koch Industries is valued at $100 billion and is one of the largest privately held companies in the United States. Marshall is one of nine members on the Koch Industries board of directors and is invested in several companies including Georgia-Pacific, Invista, Flint Hills Resources, Koch Fertilizer, Koch Pipelines, Molex, and more.</p><p>Marshall is regularly ranked as one of the wealthiest women in America. She and some family members inherited the stake in Koch Industries in 2006 after Pierce’s father, J. Howard Marshall II, passed away. J. Howard Marshall II owned approximately 16% of Koch Industries at the time of his death. He was famously married to American actress/model Anna Nicole Smith for 14 months before his death. Following his death, Anna waged a legal battle for what she believed she was owed from her late husband’s estate. The legal war made it all the way up to the United States Supreme Court twice, but Anna did not receive a penny from either J. Howard’s estate or Pierce’s estate. Elaine and Pierce Marshall had two sons and several grandchildren.</p><p>A representative of the Marshall family has stated that Elaine Marshall did not inherit E. Pierce Marshall’s entire estate, does not own 15% of Koch Industries, and is not the 68th richest person on the planet.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCxy5qgp51doq6zv8eao6VlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-eason-4-28-21.html><span>←</span><span>David Eason Threatened to Hit Daughter Ensley</span></a>
