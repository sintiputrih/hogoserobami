We know that Zen will be a part of the AM4 socket and ecosystem, and it would seem that there is at least one specific chipset for the high-end desktop market set to come later. Feel free to speculate.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/10705/AM4%20Launch%20-%20Legally%20Approved-17_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The B350 and A320 chipsets are mostly identical, using the PCIe 3.0 x4 from the CPU and offering a variety of SATA, USB and PCIe 2.0 connectivity. The PCIe 2.0 lanes, six on the B350 chipset and four on the A320 chipset, support x1, x2 and x4 modes for an array of different controllers. Perhaps the interesting thing here is the support of USB 3.1 at 10 Gbps, which is provided as native support from the chipset.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/10705/B350%20Chipset%20Blog%20Diagram.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The main provider of USB 3.1 controllers in the market currently, ASMedia, has been floated around as a partner with AMD in designing these chipsets. We asked AMD if ASMedia was involved, and to what extent, in the development or IP of the hardware. We were told that while the IP is with AMD, ASMedia were bought on as a partner in some fashion (most likely as a design firm or a consultant) to help produce the hardware. We were informed that the chipsets are manufactured at TSMC using a 55nm process, which is a much cheaper process than 28nm or 16nm.</p><p>An additional aside, the chipset USB 3.1 ports do not support reversible Type-C natively. We have been informed that a re-driver chip is required to support the revisable connectivity, which is a minor additional IC required by the OEMs.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/10705/A320%20Chipset%20Block%20Diagram.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Aside from the native USB 3.1 output, AMD’s chipset offerings are far behind Intel’s current implementation, affording up to 20 PCIe 3.0 lanes from their chipset despite the same uplink equivalent. This is partly because Intel’s chipset has steadily grown and looks more like a PCIe switch itself. AMD is claiming that the external B350 chipset, compared to the older AM3 platforms, comes down from 19.6W TDP to 5.8W TDP.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/10705/AM4%20Launch%20-%20Legally%20Approved-16_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH5xg49uZpqllGKEtbSMoJynZZKntrTAzqVkq6GUnLJurc2dZJqlZGKur63Lsqqiq12WfnN5mHFnaWWSaIJxecBsaWllk522sb%2FErWZu</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mareep-pok-c3-a9mon.html><span>←</span><span>Mareep (Pokmon) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
