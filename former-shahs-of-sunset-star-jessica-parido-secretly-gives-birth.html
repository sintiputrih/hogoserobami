I contemplated never posting about it and carrying on but IM A MOM, I have a son, a beautiful little miracle who I’ll cherish the rest of my life and to not share this would be not sharing me.”</p><p>In the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">social media reveal</a>, the Bravo personality shared a black-and-white shot of herself cradling her baby bump in a tight black dress. She also posted a video of her bursting into tears during an ultrasound appointment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Shahs-of-Sunset-Jessica-Parido-Baby-Boy.jpg><p>The California native explained her emotional response in the caption. “Since I was 15 years old I was told that the high doses of chemotherapy I got to fight my leukemia would cause me to be sterile. It was something I struggled with accepting for years. After 15 years and countless specialists, I accepted the fact I would never have children of my own. God had other plans for me. The level of shock and disbelief I had when I found out I was pregnant naturally was unimaginable. I had spent half of my life believing I would never feel these feelings.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The former reality star, who did not name the father of her child, added: “To say this came without struggle would be a lie. The traditional family I’ve dreamed of my entire life is not something I have. The vision of love, marriage then baby I had wanted is gone.”</p><p>The new mom&nbsp;was <a href=#>married to <strong>Mike Shouhed</strong></a> for less than five months before <a href=#>they separated in August 2015</a>.</p><p>“I’m so happy for you to get what you always wanted and feared you couldn’t and couldn’t, being a mom,” Parido’s ex-husband, 40, commented on her reveal. “I know in my heart and feel it in my soul that you will do an amazing job as a parent. You have a lot of love to share and wisdom from life to pass along to him. May God continue to bless the both of you with endless health and happiness.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGafp6KisrN50qGYoatdpLNuv9Snqp6sXajBor6Mo5ysq5mYrm68wKugnaddqLKkvsSto7Jll57Dpr%2BMm6CrrJhk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-bosh-wife-who-is-adrienne-williams-bosh.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Bosh Wife, Who Is Adrienne Williams Bosh?
