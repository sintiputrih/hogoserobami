Low: 65</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span></p><p>FRIDAY: A mix of clouds and sun, warm, and moderately humid with a spotty shower or thunderstorm. High: 85 Low: 66</p><p>Wednesday featured an end to the latest heatwave for most as many fell a little shy of the 90-degree mark seeing high temperatures in the mid to upper 80s. Dew points were still well into the 60s though given a fairly moisture-laden air mass, so it still felt like it was at or just above 90 degrees.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span></p><p>A cold front moved in from our west clashing with the rather humid air, and it was no surprise that this setup caused hit or miss showers and thunderstorms to bubble up as we progressed through the afternoon. About 1 to 3 inches of rain fell in areas hit by slow-moving storms, with areas around the Delaware Water Gap from Stroudsburg to Sussex and then the Delaware Valley from Lower Bucks County into Philadelphia the recipients of the heaviest rain and some flash flood warnings.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span></p><p>Stronger storms also brought some small hail and reports of damaging wind gusts, with a scattering of storm reports across eastern Pennsylvania and much of New Jersey, with storm coverage and intensity diminishing the farther west you traveled.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><span style=clear:both id=ez-clearholder-leader-2></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 leader-2 leader-2702 adtester-container adtester-container-702" data-ez-name=informationcradle_com-leader-2><span id=div-gpt-ad-informationcradle_com-leader-2-0 style=position:relative;z-index:0;padding:0;width:100%;max-width:1200px;margin-left:auto!important;margin-right:auto!important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px class=ezoic-ad></span></span></p><p>Showers and thunderstorms lingered into our early nighttime hours last night, but as is often the case, with the loss of daytime heating, we saw this activity gradually die out as we progressed into the overnight. We were left with mostly cloudy skies otherwise, patchy fog, and slightly cooler overnight low temperatures compared to previous nights as the numbers settled back into the mid to upper 60s. Dew points have also dropped a little lower in the 60s, so Thursday is getting off to a little more comfortable start compared to previous mornings.</p><p>Our cold front that tracked through Wednesday will stall to our south across the Virginias extending down into the Southeast for Thursday. Meanwhile, an area of high pressure will build across the Great Lakes into Upstate New York. The high will give us a northerly breeze and this should help usher in some slightly more comfortable air as the day wears on, certainly the further north you travel from the Lehigh Valley.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=-frequently-asked-questions-about-clayton-stiver></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Frequently Asked Questions About Clayton Stiver<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-clayton></span>Who is Clayton?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He is one of America’s best-known and loved journalists.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-clayton></span>How old is Clayton?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Information about his age is not available.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_11"></span><span style=clear:both id=ez-clearholder-leader-4></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 leader-4 leader-4706 adtester-container adtester-container-706" data-ez-name=informationcradle_com-leader-4><span id=div-gpt-ad-informationcradle_com-leader-4-0 style=position:relative;z-index:0;padding:0;width:100%;max-width:1200px;margin-left:auto!important;margin-right:auto!important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px class=ezoic-ad></span></span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-tall-is-clayton></span>How tall is Clayton?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>His height information is not available.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-clayton-married></span>Is Clayton married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He has kept his marital status private.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-is-clayton-worth></span>How much is Clayton worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>His estimated net worth is still under review.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-does-clayton-make></span>How much does Clayton make?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>His earnings are not known.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-does-clayton-live></span>Where does Clayton live?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Information about where he resides is not available.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-clayton-dead-or-alive></span>Is Clayton dead or alive?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He is alive and healthy.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_13"></span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-clayton-now></span>Where is Clayton now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He anchors at WFMZ.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=clayton-stiver-facebook></span>Clayton Stiver Facebook<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=clayton-stiver-twitter></span>Clayton Stiver Twitter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tweets by CStiverWFMZ</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=clayton-stiver-youtube></span>Clayton Stiver Youtube<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_15"></span><span style=clear:both id=ez-clearholder-leader-3></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 leader-3 leader-3710 adtester-container adtester-container-710" data-ez-name=informationcradle_com-leader-3><span id=div-gpt-ad-informationcradle_com-leader-3-0 style=position:relative;z-index:0;padding:0;width:100%;max-width:1200px;margin-left:auto!important;margin-right:auto!important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px class=ezoic-ad></span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJuclsa1u81mqq2hppq%2Fbq7IqJ6rmaCdxm6txp5knJmimrKzecSdrJyZpJ68r3nApqpmr5aix26ywJyrrGWUpLqitc2YbWZrXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tell-me-your-secrets-what-to-expect-from-season-2.html><span>←</span><span>Tell Me Your Secrets: What To Expect From A Possible Season 2</span></a>
