American football quarterback Jared Thomas Goff plays for the National Football League’s Detroit Lions. He played college football at California, where he was named to the first team of the Pac-12, and the Los Angeles Rams selected him first overall in the 2016 NFL Draft.</p><p>A lot of people have been inquiring lot about Jared Goff children and making various research about them on the internet.</p><p>This article talks about Jared Goff children and everything there is to know about them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Biography of Jared Goff</h2><p>Goff was born on October 14, 1994, in Novato, California, as Jared Thomas Goff, the second child of Nancy and former professional athlete Jerry Goff. Jared Goff has a sister called Lauren Goff. She attended the University of California at Berkeley. Goff was an avid participant in baseball, football, and soccer starting at a young age. But it wasn’t until he entered Marin Catholic High School in Kentfield, California, that he started concentrating solely on the American pastime.</p><p>Jared Goff played three seasons of varsity football for his high school, completing 477 of 767 passes for a 62.2% completion rate and 7,687 yards. Then, when his team went 39-4 overall and qualified for a North Coast Section title and three MCAL titles, he scored 93 touchdowns and 18 interceptions.</p><p>Goff was extensively courted by numerous college programs across the country after he completed high school, but he decided to stay in the warm weather and enroll at the University of California, Berkeley, the alma mater of his father.</p><p>As a true freshman in 2013, Goff was selected as the starting quarterback for the first game of his team’s season, making Berkeley history. The following year, despite the team’s appalling 1-11 record, he started all twelve of his team’s games and set single-season school records in a number of categories, including yards, yardage gains, completed passes, and pass attempts.</p><p>Jared Goff continued to develop as a player in his second season, setting yet another school record and contributing to his team’s better record of 5-7. Goff led his club to its first winning season as a junior, ending with a 7-5 record and being named to the first team of the Pac-12. Goff declared after that season that he will forgo his final year of college in order to enter the draft.</p><p>He completed 977 of 1,569 passes over the course of his three-year collegiate football career for 12,220 yards, 96 touchdowns, and 30 interceptions. He then signed with the Los Angeles Rams, who had taken him with the first overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft.</p><p>Jared Goff has over 326K followers on Instagram.

Jared Goff has an estimated net worth of $30 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does Jared Goff have any children?</h2><p>No, Jared has no children at the moment.
