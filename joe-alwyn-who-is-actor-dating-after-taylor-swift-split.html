However, the star did recently break his social media silence since the split with a series of snapshots from his life, which he shared alongside a wave emoji and a camera emoji.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aa472a6749aa-screen-shot-2023-04-20-at-112905-am.png><p id=emzPLtMs30Z data-wc=44>The photos included a throwback snap of himself dressed as Robin Hood, as well as a wooden chair in a house by the coast, an ivy covered house and a performance from Bon Iver – but didn't contain a hint of any current romance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7f6af032e759-3755080676870076899492727341145321225274694n.jpg><h3>Why did Joe Alwyn and Taylor Swift split?</h3><p id=eCFc7iVnLCj data-wc=58>While both parties have been tight-lipped about <a class=hm-link href=#>the circumstances surrounding their split</a>, the most telling details of the break-up have perhaps come from Taylor's single 'You're Losing Me', with the lyrics reading: "You say, 'I don't understand,' and I say, 'I know you don't'/ We thought a cure would come through in time, now, I fear it won't."</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">LA exes: 5 Hollywood couples who divorced</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/22c27f5eb67c-gettyimages-609273290.jpg><h4 data-gid=e5gHn87eBR7>1. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie</h4><p id=ehdnPPvIlyO>Known by the legendary portmanteau 'Brangelina', the uber A-listers wed in a French chateau in 2014 some nine years after first becoming entwined on the set of 2005 blockbuster . Things went south soon after with allegations of abuse surfacing in 2016, the same year Angelina filed for divorce. After seven years of legal wrangling light appeared at the tunnel's end, with the reporting in July 2023 that the pair had agreed to a mediation which could resolve their dispute.</p><h4><strong>2. Ryan Reynolds and Scarlett Johansson</strong></h4><p id=eeFFD521Lyx>Ryan and Scarlett married in 2008 in a secretive ceremony on Vancouver Island. Both actors' stars were firmly in the ascendancy but professional success wasn't conducive to conjugal happiness, and their union was annulled just over two years later with Scarlett subsequently revealing the couple hardly saw each other.&nbsp;</p><h4>3. Russell Brand and Katy Perry</h4><p id=e7wn394znW>The polysyllabic and polyamorous British actor/comedian/presenter met popstar Katy in 2009 during rehearsals for the MTV Video Music Awards.

Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes</h4><p id=eq0IotUnUd>The archetypal whirlwind romance, Tom and Katie got engaged after just seven weeks of dating in 2005. The pair didn't muck about and the following year they both welcomed daughter Suri and got married in a Scientologist ceremony in Italy. The marriage lasted for five and half years before Katie filed for divorce.</p><p id=eXZUSdmGnY- data-wc=18>Another lyric read: "And I wouldn't marry me either/A pathological people pleaser/Who only wanted you to see her."</p><p id=emU__yHGqRE data-wc=31>Otherwise, details about their split have come from sources, with reporting that Joe struggled with Taylor's fame, while it was also reported that they split over differences in their personalities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/387dba5e0871-gettyimages-1456009339.jpg><p id=eiUa3N3d2w- data-wc=30>Despite sources calling the split amicable, fans noticed that several of the&nbsp; singer's close friends unfollowed Joe from social media after the break-up, including <strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong> and <strong>Gigi Hadid</strong>.</p><h3>What have Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn said about each other?</h3><p id=e0AI1Zs330v data-wc=42>While Joe and Taylor very rarely spoke about one another in public during their six-year relationship, Taylor spoke about Joe in her 2020 documentary, .
