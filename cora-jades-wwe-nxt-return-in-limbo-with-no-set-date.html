She walked out, and it appears that they are going with that angle.</p><p>Following Jade’s latest post asking fans to stop asking for her return, Bodyslam.net asked around with NXT sources about Cora Jade’s status amidst her hiatus. We were told that Jade has been absent from tapings since she “walked out” on NXT during the August 1st edition of the show, and there has been no timetable for when she will return to the brand.</p><p>It was also reported that, “there has also been no word on a potential call-up to the main roster for the former NXT Women’s Tag Team Champion.”</p><p>Cora Jade’s last NXT appearance saw Dana Brooke beat her in a Kendo Stick Match on the July 25th episode of NXT. A lot of things have happened since then, like <a href=#>Dana Brooke’s WWE release</a>.</p><p>We will have to see what is next for Cora Jade. She has a ton of potential, and WWE just may be saving her back for something bigger down the line.
