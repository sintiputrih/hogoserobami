It is lovingly referred to as “the caviar of the South” and I have to agree!&nbsp;</p><p>When we were driving through Georgia, my husband, who is an avid golfer, had to stop by Augusta National Golf Course in Georgia to peek in at the beauty of it. The Master’s Golf Tournament is played every year in the same place and they are known for their famous pimento cheese sandwiches, served on basic white bread.</p><p>This is the beloved weekend where golf fanatics everywhere are glued to the TV and since we live in Arizona and can’t order a pimento cheese sandwich, I made one for him to celebrate his favorite golf tournament.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is Pimento Cheese Spread made of?</h2><p>Pimento Cheese Spread can be made with different variations of ingredients but generally, it is made with cream cheese, mayonnaise, chopped pimentos from a jar, cheddar cheese, cayenne pepper, and salt. You can add in hot sauce, jalapenos, and more cayenne for extra spice.&nbsp;</p><h2>What are pimentos?</h2><p>A pimento is a cherry pepper that is usually red in color. Pimento peppers are small heart-shaped sweet peppers with a mild flavor and are considered mild on the heat scale. Pimento peppers are mild, sweet, and not considered spicy but offer a good flavor payout. They are generally pickled, chopped, and served in jars.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Pimento-Cheese-Dip-7.jpg alt="This pimento cheese dip is famous in the South for good reason.

Since it is a cream cheese and mayonnaise-based dip it is important to serve cold. I suggest chilling the pimento cheese dip until ready to serve guests or use as a spread.</p><h2>How to make Pimento Cheese Dip:</h2><li><strong>Start by softening the cream cheese so it easily incorporates into the other ingredients</strong>. I suggest using a stand mixer, such as a Kitchenaid, or a hand mixer for this recipe to make sure you get the cream cheese and mayonnaise mixture extra creamy. You can stir it by hand as well but just make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature.</li><li><strong>Chop the jarred pimentos</strong>. Fold into the cream cheese mixture. Grate the mild cheddar and sharp cheddar cheeses and fold them into the pimento dip.</li><li><strong>Season it with cayenne pepper</strong>, a touch of salt to taste, and hot sauce, if so desired.</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Pimento-Cheese-Dip-Recipe.jpg alt="This pimento cheese dip is famous in the South for good reason.
