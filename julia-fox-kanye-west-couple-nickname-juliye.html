Brad Pitt </strong>and <strong>Angelina Jolie </strong>were <strong>Brangelina</strong>. <strong>Jennifer Lopez </strong>and <strong>Ben Affleck </strong>loved <strong>Bennifer </strong>so much that they gave us “Bennifer 2.0.” Now, the world has been blessed with a new couple’s moniker to commemorate the blessed union of <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Julia Fox</a> </strong>and <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kanye West</a></strong>. Julia, 31, did the honors of unveiling this new romantic portmanteau on Monday (Jan. 24), right after she and Kanye, 44, appeared at Paris Men’s Fashion Week. Julia <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>posted a photo of her and Kanye</a> at the Schiaparelli Haute Couture Spring/Summer 2022 show to her Instagram Story. At the bottom, she captioned the pic of them in matching leather with “Juliye,” along with a black heart emoji.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Juliye” is similar to “Kimye,” the name for Kanye and his estranged wife, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>. When fans learned of this new name, their reaction was mixed. “Juliye??????? You thought you ate” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a> one, while another <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote</a>, “I lost the plot when she called herself juliye! Like girl, no!” “JULIYE”…. i like it,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>added</a> one fan, while another <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>said</a>, “I kinda like juliye.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Julia-Fox-kanye-west-shutter-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>“not here for juliye or whatever the hell they are calling them i just want kimye back,” <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote</a> one fan. Unfortunately for them, it seems like Kimye is not coming back. Kim, 41, is currently enjoying her new romance with <strong>Pete Davidson</strong>, and Ye had something to say about that when <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he sat down with</a> Hollywood Unlocked’s&nbsp;<strong>Jason Lee</strong>. “This is for anybody that’s going through a separation, and people intentionally do things to be mean and hurt you– to be playing games,” he said in the interview. “How you gonna bring me to SNL and kiss the dude you dating right in front of me, and everybody’s like, ‘Aw, that’s cool.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Julia-Fox-kanye-west-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Ye also spoke about clashing with Kim over allowing their eldest daughter, <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>North West</a>,&nbsp;</strong>8, to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wear makeup</a>. The rapper said he instructed his cousins to tell Kim that she shouldn’t allow Ye’s daughter to “[wear] lipstick on TikTok. And don’t have her TikTok at all if I don’t approve [of] that. And I said it after it was done without me knowing. And then it happened again. So I feel like it’s poking the bear or trying to antagonize me or create this crazy narrative.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5FuZqOtnJ6ubrLOsWSkmZ6usm7DxKyrZpufqr2tsYynoJyjnpa6pnnJrqOisZVk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-kate-micucci-make-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does Kate Micucci Make?
