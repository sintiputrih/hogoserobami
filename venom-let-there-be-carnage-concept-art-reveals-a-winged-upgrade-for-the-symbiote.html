Recommended Videos In a post to Artstation by concept artist Adam Burn, Carnage can be seen in what would have been his ultimate form kitted out with gigantic wings.
According to the description that Burn attached to the concept art, it comes from a time in development when Carnage was going to have an ultimate form referred to as the “Uber form”."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
