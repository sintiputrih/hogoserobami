Mariah Carey, who flaunts her toned tummy and 30-pound weight loss story on May’s Shape cover, was eager to show off her slimmer figure in Austria Sunday.

But despite taking the stage in the ill-fitting, Fashion Police-destined ensemble, the 42-year-old singer was all smiles and in good spirits for her fans."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
