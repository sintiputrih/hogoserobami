Know all about the boxings famous defense move</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Floyd Mayweather </strong>is one of the most famous boxers in the world. Furthermore, Mayweather competed for two decades and has fought 50 times with 0 losses. In addition to his success in the ring, he also made a lot of money from his boxing career. Throughout his career, Floyd Mayweather utilized Philly Shell and footwork to establish himself as the greatest defensive boxer in history.</p><p>People know Mayweather for his luxurious lifestyle, and he has a net worth of $450 Million. Furthermore, people know <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Floyd Mayweather</a> for his technical knowledge in the ring, hard work, and dedication. Mayweather trained wherever he wanted, which remained his defining characteristic. Subsequently, he often went for runs after a night out, regardless of his outfit or shoes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>He is also well-known for his excellent defensive skills and reflexes, which is why the shoulder roll is so popular. Originally known as ‘The Philly Shell,’ the shoulder roll is a technique that<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Mayweather has honed</a> throughout his 20-year professional boxing career. Furthermore, it enabled him to remain unbeaten against 50 professional boxers.</p><p>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Floyd Mayweather Fight Record: How many losses does ‘Money Mayweather’ have?</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-often-did-floyd-mayweather-use-philly-shell><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_often_did_Floyd_Mayweather_use_%E2%80%98Philly_Shell></span>How often did Floyd Mayweather use ‘Philly Shell’?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>T.B.E. didn’t come up with the Philly Shell or the shoulder roll. Mayweather effectively utilized it for his fights. The Philly Shell is one of boxing’s most brilliant defensive strategies. It allows a boxer to neutralize his opponent’s jabs completely. Whenever a boxer threw a jab, the opponent’s shoulder came up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Floyd-Mayweather-1024x768.jpg><p>Hence, the jab either slides off or bounces off the shoulder, never reaching the intended target. Floyd Mayweather honed this technique by adding his own reflexes and counter-punching, making it unstoppable. The Philly Shell helped Mayweather to effectively combat some of the best boxers like <strong>Oscar De La Hoya</strong>, <strong>Manny Pacquiao</strong>, and <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Canelo Alvarez</a></strong>. He neutralized their offensive style with his defensive prowess.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-philly-shell-was-used-before-floyd-mayweather-in-boxing><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Philly_Shell_was_used_before_Floyd_Mayweather_in_boxing></span>The Philly Shell was used before Floyd Mayweather in boxing<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The ‘<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Philly Shell</a>‘ is mostly thought to have been initially used in the Philadelphia boxing gymnasiums, hence the name. One of the most famous fighting cities in the world is Philadelphia, and it has always had an endless supply of raw talent. Furthermore, with fighters like &nbsp;<strong>George Benton</strong>, <strong>Joe Frazier</strong>, and <strong>Bernard Hopkins</strong>, it’s clear that Philadelphia has produced some of the greatest boxers ever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/floyd1-2.jpg><p>Watching any of Hopkins’ later fights demonstrated the design and usage of the Philly Shell in a fight or sparring session.&nbsp;In the late rounds of the fight, Hopkins would “Shell Up” to the ropes to get his opponent’s attention. Subsequently, if they got close enough, they would be afraid of the counter. The counter banked from the Philly Shell could prove deadly. However, Mayweather forged an undefeated career with Philly Shell.</p><p>In Case You Missed It!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57waivoqaXYsSprdNmoKxllqG8urCMppiyr5WWwamx0WanoaGcocZuv8eeo6Vn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nick-mcglashan-wiki-age-net-worth-cause-of-death-drugs-illness-obituary-deadliest-catch-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Nick McGlashan Wiki, Age, Net Worth, Cause of Death, Drugs, Illness, Obituary, Deadliest Catch, Inst</span></a>
