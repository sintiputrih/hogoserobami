Both actors were dressed in black tops and jeans and appeared comfortable while they waited for their son, who was running around outside with friends.</p><p>Affleck and Garner’s reunion marked the first time the exes were seen together after the Good Will Hunting star’s candid remarks about <a href=#>their October 2018 divorce</a>. The couple <a href=#>called it quits in June 2015</a> after 10 years of marriage and also share two daughters, Violet, 14, and Seraphina, 10, along with Sam.</p><p>“The biggest regret of my life is this divorce,” Affleck told the <a href=#>New York Times</a> earlier this month while promoting his new film, The Way Back. “Shame is really toxic. There is no positive by-product of shame. It’s just stewing in a toxic, hideous feeling of low self-worth and self-loathing.”</p><p>The Justice League star, who has previously opened up about his <a href=#>struggle with addiction and alcoholism</a>, admitted that his drinking “created more marital problems” ahead of his split from Garner. Days after his emotional interview with the Times, Affleck revealed that the separation was “so painful.”</p><p>“I never thought that I was gonna get divorce. I didn’t want to get divorced. I didn’t want to be a divorced person. I really <a href=#>didn’t want to be a split family</a> with my children,” he told<a href=#> <strong>Diane Sawyer</strong></a> during an appearance on Good Morning America. “And it upset me because it meant I wasn’t who I thought I was. And that was so painful and so disappointing in myself.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Affleck’s road to recovery was a long one, as he <a href=#>completed three separate stints in rehab</a> before October 2018. After a “slip-up” in his sobriety one year later, the 13 Going On 30 star was a supportive presence for her ex-husband because she still wanted him “to be in the kids’ lives.” The Oscar winner thanked Garner with a touching note, read aloud on Good Morning America earlier this month.</p><p>“What I want to say <a href=#>publicly and privately</a> is, ‘Thank you. Thank you for being thoughtful, considerate, responsible, and a great mom and person,” the actor’s letter said.</p><p>Scroll down to see more of Affleck and Garner’s reunion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr6a6jJqdn6SVmLhuv8SepWavmam1brbEp6WinpWneqit0aecq2WRm8GmvoydoK%2Bnopiybr7Er5ylmaSevK97</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kenzie-dalton-net-worth-201570.html><span>←</span><span>Kenzie Dalton Net Worth</span></a>
