Mascara is a low-maintenance, highly effective way to quickly lengthen, volumize, and even strengthen your growth-challenged eyelashes. Some mascaras even have innovative wands and brushes that help you work with the lashes you’ve got for a dramatic, eye-catching look that’s all you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are literally hundreds of mascaras out there, and not all were meant for the short-lashed among us. We went straight to the pros — like celebrity makeup artists <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Jamie Greenberg</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Nydia Figueroa</a> and beauty expert <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nocaes>Katya Bychkova</a> — to understand which ingredients, formulas, and wands enhance diminutive lashes. After hearing their expertise and reflecting on our own experience as beauty editors who test mascaras on the regular, we can say with confidence these are the best mascaras for short lashes.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-rare-beauty-by-selena-gomez-perfect-strokes-universal-volumizing-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rare Beauty by Selena Gomez Perfect Strokes Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rare Beauty Perfect Strokes Universal Volumizing Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ToICp3rSziryUnf1Vl39uUzR4IQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign28-ed4db69aecf241b188be078257b22d39.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Selena Gomez’s makeup line, Rare Beauty, has some of the best beauty products on the market — which is one of the reasons why Perfect Strokes Mascara secured our best overall spot. This vegan mascara is made with all lash sizes in mind, giving them the length, volume, and curl they deserve. The curvy wand has both long and short bristles that work together to distribute the castor-oil-infused formula, making it buildable and clump-free. Speaking of the formula, on top of the volumizing benefits, it’s vegan, cruelty-free, and ophthalmologist-tested, meaning it’s safe for all eyes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What we especially love about this product for short lashes is that it adds a gorgeous amount of length that still looks natural. It also gives lashes a lift and adds sturdy volume that doesn't flake. It’s easy to build on, so if you want a more dramatic look, just apply one to two extra coats while the formula is wet (anything more can result in some clumpiness). And, although this product grips onto lashes for all-day wear, it’s easy to wash off with warm water and soap.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits: </strong>Lengthens, volumizes, lifts, and curls<strong> </strong>|<strong> Shades: </strong>Black<strong> </strong>|<strong> Waterproof: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-maybelline-new-york-volum-express-pumped-up-colossal-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Maybelline Colossal Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1500 data-sizes=750px alt="Maybelline New York Volum' Express Pumped Up Colossal Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/TmAbANxTYonruR7Mlrwaa7yV59Y=/fit-in/1500x1500/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/MaybellineNewYorkVolumExpressPumpedUpColossalMascara-e7c4b64c856443dcaf1e9574546ff3b6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you want big, bold lashes for less than $10, this Maybelline classic will give you all that and more. The Volum’ Express Pumped Up! formula is infused with collagen, which wraps around lashes to deliver a voluminous finish. The mascara itself is smooth and milky when first applied, but it dries quickly and provides a nice base to build on. Additionally, the plump brush has a double-curved stem that ensures every lash is coated – even the extra short ones.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We will note that the formula is very easy to wash off, which is both good and bad. It’s good because it means you can take off your mascara with just soap and water (as opposed to eye makeup remover or micellar water), but on the other hand, this can cause a problem if lashes unexpectedly get wet. And while we love the chunky brush, be wary that the large shape makes it more likely for the formula to end up on your eyelids, especially if you have hooded eyes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits: </strong>Volumizes |<strong> Shades: </strong>Black |<strong> Waterproof: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-chanel-le-volume-de-chanel-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chanel Le Volume de Chanel Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="CHANEL Le Volume de CHANEL Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ezBAFo-e2KhDYi_xWl_6ANf9CvQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/chanel-le-volume-de-chanel-mascara-094cf9a978ac48daaeffccd8e99fc203.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Chanel</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Chanel knows luxury. The designer brand is recognized for its high-end products, and when it comes to mascara, Le Volume de Chanel is the crème de la crème. This mascara instantly volumizes short lashes, making them look longer, bolder, and more noticeable. The innovative formula is one of a kind due to its ability to expand once it is applied to lashes, plumping them to their fullest. The mascara’s ingredients include synthetic beeswax and carnauba wax — both of which cling to lashes to add volume — as well as acacia gum, which helps to curl and set lashes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, this wand is also worthy of praise: The exclusive 'Snowflakes' brush combines long and short bristles that work together to create an eye-opening effect on short lashes. (You may want to use a smaller brush for your lower lashes, though, to prevent any mishaps.) Since both the wand and the formula deliver instant volume, you’ll only need a few coats of this luxe product to achieve head-turning results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits:</strong> Volumizes, lengthens, and curls<strong> </strong>|<strong> Shades: </strong>Black, Night Blue |<strong> Waterproof: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lengthening-lancme-dfincils-high-definition-lengthening-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lengthening</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lancôme Lengthening Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lanc&amp;Atilde;&amp;acute;me D&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;fincils High Definition Lengthening Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/cYe8WBC_g5GR7V4RwRXLEWELHJw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Lancome-Defincils-High-Definition-Lengthening-Mascara-8495be6f2c3d474cb93eba78896f1364.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I discovered this mascara when I was in middle school (read: years ago) after my grandmother let me use it before a school dance. After putting on a few coats, I noticed how my lashes looked long and fluttery, but also natural and full. Since then, I have been using this for special events, date nights, and times when I really want to amp up my lash look. It does a great job of separating lashes and ensuring each one is coated.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not only does this mascara add wildly long length, but it also creates incredible volume. Lashes look naturally full and are free from clumps and flaking. This can be attributed to the brush’s “hedgehog” bristles, which dispense the perfect amount of formula onto the lashes, creating a gradual and even application. For best results, I would suggest using a lash primer first. From there, you can add as many layers of mascara as you want (just make sure each one dries first).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits: </strong>Volumizes and lengthens |<strong> Shades: </strong>Black<strong> </strong>|<strong> Waterproof: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-thickening-too-faced-better-than-sex-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Thickening</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/SiLbbJHonT9YQ7HjLYr6afvedAo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/too-faced-better-than-sex-mascara-39cfa32af6974b56bf2b1b71a34cc591.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Too Faced’s Better Than Sex Mascara has a cult following for a reason: As the number one best-selling mascara in the U.S., this product is excellent for all kinds of lashes – especially short ones. The formula was created to enhance lashes, making them darker, more defined, and extra full. The ingredients include film-forming polymers that work to create and set a lash curl, as well as Acacia Senegal tree extract, which helps to provide volume. Additionally, a combination of peptides effortlessly condition lashes with each coat.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from the notable formula, this mascara also has a cheeky packaging that has added to the allure. With a luxe baby pink bottle and a fat, hourglass brush, this mascara is just as aesthetically pleasing as it is efficient. It can make lashes look multidimensional since the hourglass brush separates, coats, and curls individual lashes. It's worth noting that you should let the formula dry a bit before applying more coats to avoid clumping. For best results when wearing this mascara, top it off with your favorite <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>setting spray</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits:</strong> Lengthens and volumizes |<strong> Shades: </strong>Black<strong> </strong>|<strong>&nbsp; Waterproof: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-curling-tower-28-beauty-makewaves-lengthening--volumizing-clean-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Curling</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tower 28 Beauty MakeWaves Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tower 28 Beauty MakeWaves Lengthening &amp;amp; Volumizing Clean Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kxWzSkjwcMa-muG1PI5nOeF9Mo8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign19-84ac4cdbeeef4f89964707eacb7c64c2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a mascara that creates, sets, and holds a curl, you can’t go wrong with this Tower 28 bestseller. It has a vegan formula that works to lift lashes, setting them in place for hours on end. The ‘Triple-Wave’ wand helps create the long-lasting curl, thanks to three flexible suspended bands that lengthen and build boldness. Additionally, this product has a clean, lightweight formula that is clump-free even after applying multiple coats. It works well with short lashes due to its thickening formula that adds length and fullness.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"I love the Tower 28 mascara because it really gets to the root of my lashes and lifts them up,” says InStyle Commerce Writer, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Caitlyn Martyn</a>. “As someone with short lashes, I appreciate that it gives them length, but in doing so doesn't make them too long that they're rubbing (and then smearing) against my hooded eyes. And, even if they do reach that high, I never ever notice smudging, which is an issue that I have with pretty much every other mascara."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits: </strong>Lengthens and curls<strong> </strong>|<strong> Shades: </strong>Black |<strong> Waterproof: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lifting-benefit-cosmetics-roller-lash-curling-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lifting</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Benefit Cosmetics Roller Lash Curling Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Roller Lash Curling &amp;amp; Lifting Mascara " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PD60a6GL0UIjVZsyYwGjbk0tYZo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/roller-lash-curling--lifting-mascara--58806713bfe04cfaa97d93730c109618.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This fan-favorite mascara was inspired by hair rollers, which means it provides an impressive curl. While it does a remarkable job of curling lashes, it also has the ability to lift them to new heights – especially short lashes in particular. The wand, which Benefit has coined as a ‘Hook ‘n' Roll’ brush, can grab, separate, and lift lashes with just one swipe. Thanks to the long-lasting formula, this mascara can also hold lashes in place for up to 12 hours.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On top of that, it’s made with provitamin B5 and serine, both of which are known for their lash-conditioning benefits. The silky, hydrating formula has a jet-black hue and leaves behind the prettiest satin finish. Even though this mascara is not waterproof, we suggest taking it off with an oil-based cleanser since that can break it down better. Note that if mega volume is what you’re after, you probably won’t find it in this, but if you’re after lift and curl there’s no better option.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits: </strong>Lengthens, curls, and lifts<strong> </strong>|<strong> Shades: </strong>Jet Black |<strong> Waterproof: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-volumizing-essence-cosmetics-lash-princess-false-lash-effect-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Volumizing</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Essence Cosmetics Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Essence Cosmetics Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vh0-CrU-LV76q0WIFj1A5wxPrmI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/essence-cosmetics-lash-princess-false-lash-effect-mascara-abe9395f30f44c26bafa450e7b0294ea.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Essence mascara has the words “false lash effect” in the name, which is a telling sign of what this product can do. In terms of short lashes, this mascara has the ability to build them out, making them longer and thicker than other mascaras. The formula can seem a bit goopy at first, but once it dries, it clings to lashes and adds tantalizing volume.

You won’t find oils, parabens, or fragrances on the ingredient list, which is also another major plus. Additionally, the formula works in tandem with the conical-shaped fiber brush to help lengthen and lift lashes for a fuller and more voluminous appearance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits: </strong>Volumizes, lengthens, and curls<strong> </strong>|<strong> Shades: </strong>Black<strong> </strong>|<strong> Waterproof: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-clean-ilia-limitless-lash-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Clean</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ILIA Limitless Lash Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ILIA Beauty Limitless Lash Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/NqcD6zp6CeCllDg5ERxQQ0HZlwo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ILIA-Beauty-Limitless-Lash-Mascara-4337959bf702425aacd9064afe0eb89d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermstore</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>This cruelty-free formula is made with nourishing ingredients like keratin, shea butter, and beeswax.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ilia has always impressed us with its clean formulas and long-lasting products (hello, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fan-favorite Super Serum Skin Tint SPF 40</a> is amazing), and the brand’s mascara is one of our most beloved beauty products. It has a clean, gentle formula that’s safe for both people with sensitive skin as well as contact-wearers. Containing good-for-your-lash ingredients like keratin and beeswax (which fortify and nourish lashes) as well as shea butter, it conditions lashes to ensure you don’t experience clumping. What’s more, is that these natural ingredients are great for short lashes since they can help the hair follicles stimulate growth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another one of our favorite things about this mascara is that it has a two-sided brush — one with short bristles that curl lashes, and one with longer bristles that work to lift them. The best part: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Melanie Simon</a>, Jennifer Aniston's facialist, once said this mascara is "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>almost as good as lash extensions</a>."

This product is my holy grail mascara for a slew of reasons (one being all of the compliments I get when I wear it), but mainly because of its super thin, lightweight formula. I previously never wore waterproof mascara, but after I changed my skincare routine last winter, I noticed my mascara was smudging both above and below my eyes. To fix this, I went on a hunt for the best waterproof mascara that added length to my lashes without making them look spidery. I also wanted a waterproof mascara that was easy to wash off and didn’t harm my lashes in the process.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The verdict: This drugstore option was and still is my overall favorite. I immediately loved the length it gave as well as its buildability. It doesn't offer much volume, but if you’re like me and want a natural-looking mascara, this is ideal. (If you want to add volume, simply top this off with a coat of volumizing mascara.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What’s also impressive about this product is that it is ophthalmologist and allergy tested, which means it is suitable for sensitive eyes and contact wearers.

It has been tested both backstage and on set, ensuring every beauty look is bold and dramatic. Like lash extensions in a tube, this mascara is ultra-buildable, elongating each lash (even super short ones), adding a noticeable lift, and amping up volume. Additionally, this Pat McGrath product is made with peptides and panthenol, which means it hydrates and conditions lashes. The nourishing formula also helps to prevent lashes from falling out in the future.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One particularly notable thing about this mascara is the brush. It has staggered bristles, which ensure that the formula reaches every lash, coating them from root to tip. Due to the sophisticated brush structure, lashes become fanned out and full. We do wish the brush was a bit smaller, though, to ensure the most seamless application. Overall, the sheer amount of lash looks you can create with this is unmatched: From natural fluttery lashes to extremely noticeable ones, this mascara has you covered.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits: </strong>Lengthens, volumizes, and curls<strong> </strong>|<strong> Shades: </strong>Black<strong> </strong>|<strong> Waterproof: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-natural-looking-maybelline-full-n-soft-washable-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Natural-Looking</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Maybelline Washable Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1500 data-sizes=750px alt="Maybelline Full 'N Soft Washable Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4MZo-w-w4_wESKmW-e8Nk48ElT0=/fit-in/1500x1500/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/MaybellineFullNSoftWashableMascara-c56b49f6e56b442baf91992353989117.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Prefer your short lashes to look naturally long? Let us introduce you to this beloved Maybelline mascara. The popular drugstore option is infused with vitamin E to hydrate your lash line, creating a softer, more natural beauty look. Its handy wand expertly separates lashes, which allows the product to go on smoothly and clump-free. Additionally, this mascara lengthens and adds thickness to lashes after just a few coats. For best results, it’s recommended to not let the formula dry when layering this mascara. While this can sometimes create clumps since the mascara is still wet, try using a disposable mascara wand to clean up lashes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This mascara also comes in waterproof and non-waterproof options, so you can choose which one works best for you.

The vegan, cruelty-free formula is made with lash-enhancing ingredients including shea butter and castor seed oil, which both condition lashes during wear. Additionally, it’s powered by what Thrive refers to as a ‘Flake-Free Tubing Technology,’ which adds length to short lashes. Since this is a tubing mascara, the formula works overtime to wrap each lash in a lightweight ‘tube,’ making the mascara easier to build.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another great callout: This product is water-resistant and smudge-proof, even in extreme humidity.

Complete with a lash primer on one side and mascara on the other, this top-rated product delivers length, lift, and natural volume. The clean formula is infused with jojoba esters, which enhances lashes’ fullness and adds a subtle curl. It’s also free from parabens, synthetic fragrances, and silicones, and the packaging is biodegradable and recyclable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since the primer and mascara come together, the two products work together to make lashes look their best. The primer creates a clump-free base for the mascara to glide onto, while the mascara grips to lashes, adding volume and length. For maximum results, evenly brush the mascara primer through lashes from root to tip and wait about 30 seconds for it to dry. Then, apply a few coats of mascara to lashes, wiggling the brush as you go.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits: </strong>Lengthens, volumizes, and lifts<strong> </strong>|<strong> Shades: </strong>Black |<strong> Waterproof: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tubing-tarte-tartelette-tubing-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tubing</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tarte Tarte Tartelette Tubing Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tarte Tartelette Tubing Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZSD_hbI2ojSqLxOeJ4iasIfE_qQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tarte-tartelette-tubing-mascara-b8058814424c4354b1e3dfe47e4b0929.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Want a smudge-proof, humidity-resistant mascara?

These can help to separate and elongate each individual lash.

(Our best overall pick <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Rare Beauty Perfect Strokes Universal Volumizing Mascara</a> has a fluffy brush made for adding mega volume.) A thicker wand is able to coat multiple lashes at once, which makes it easier to build on top of previous coats. As for a mascara that will lift and curl lashes, we suggest looking for a curved wand. This will help create, set, and keep the curl in place once mascara is applied.

For years, my favorite has been <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Dior Diorshow Maximizer 3D Lash Primer</a>; it adds definition to your lashes and makes your lashes appear longer and thicker,” she adds.

Bychkova recommends what she calls the “tight line technique.” This consists of applying eyeliner in between lashes to help create the illusion of thicker lashes.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is the best way to remove mascara?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Greenberg, using an oil cleanser or makeup remover is the safest way to remove mascara. “A good cleanser should also hopefully get it off,” she adds. This is because oil-based cleansers can easily break down mascara formulas without damaging lashes in the process.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not surprisingly, makeup removers are also a fool-proof way to take off mascara. To get the best and safest results from a makeup remover, wet a cotton round with the solution, then gently rub eyes. “Never use the same cotton round on both eyes, though: If there is an infection in one of your eyes, you risk spreading it to both eyes,” notes Bychkova.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of being eco-conscious, there are also other things to use besides cotton pads. “A quick tip: You can get a set of reusable makeup-removing pads in order to stop buying cotton rounds and save the environment,” says Bychkova. “My favorite ones are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Eco Pads</a> that you can get for just $10 for a set of three.
