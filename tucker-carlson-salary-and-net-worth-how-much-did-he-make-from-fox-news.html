Indeed, millions of people devoted themselves to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">nonsensical, bigoted, unintelligent bile</a>, resulting in him becoming one of the highest-paid cable news hosts of all time.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=68 data-current-count=68 data-injectable=false>Here’s how much Carlson earned throughout his tenure on Fox.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-how-much-did-tucker-carlson-make-from-fox-news data-injectable=false>How much did Tucker Carlson make from Fox News?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/tucker-carlson-2.jpg><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true>As mentioned, Tucker Carlson Tonight spent several years at the top of the highest-watched cable news program. Despite talking out of both sides of his mouth (the man <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted to despising</a> Donald Trump off-air), Carlson’s specific brand of right-wing conspiracy earned him a loyal fan base and a pretty penny.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=253 data-injectable=false>According to <a href=#>Yahoo! Finance</a>, the 53-year-old news host brought in $8 million per year at Fox, making him fifth among the list of richest cable news hosts. In first place is his former colleague, Sean Hannity, with a whopping $25 million per year salary.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-tucker-carlson-s-net-worth data-injectable=false>What is Tucker Carlson’s net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tucker-carlson.jpg><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>Sure, there are other cable news hosts with larger salaries than Carlson’s, but being a cable news host isn’t the man’s only source of income, and not just because he was fired. In 2020, he co-founded The Daily Caller, a far-right opinion-based news outlet&nbsp;with political advisor, Neil Patel.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>Thanks to The Daily Caller and his years of devoted service to journalistic dishonesty — let’s not forget his lies about the 2020 election and Dominion Voting System, which contributed to Fox News’ $787.5 million settlement with the voting company — Carlson’s net worth is around $30 million, according to Yahoo! Finance.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=165 data-injectable=false>That’s $30 million with a big three-oh; for spreading lies, hate, and talking out of both sides of his mouth.
