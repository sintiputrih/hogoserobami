They began a relationship, and soon got serious.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Stephanie and Jenna went on to get hitched in 2013 and then had two daughters together — Harper came along the same year the couple said "I do," while Quinn was born in 2015.</p><p>Things seemed to be going along great for the family of four, until 2020 hit, and the COVID-19 pandemic took a toll on the two TV personalities.

The former personal trainer opened up to People about what happened between the parents while quarantining together during the pandemic.</p><p style=text-align:start>“There's a lot of beautiful ego that comes with one person being on television,” Jenna told the outlet. “But when there's two people on television, plus both kids trying to do Zoom school in a Manhattan apartment, there's just no space anywhere."</p><p style=text-align:start>For the couple, the solution was to part ways as "great friends," and "loving parents."</p><p style=text-align:start>“We decided after that, in order to preserve the relationship, it was better that Steph moved out,” Jenna candidly explained.</p><p>Then, in 2023, Jenna decided to undergo a preventative hysterectomy and mastectomy after her mom was <a href=#>diagnosed with breast</a> and lymph node cancer.</p><p>"Mastectomy behind me," she shared in an Instagram post following her brave procedure. "All that’s left now is recovery and healing… The most important part. The hardest part."</p><p>She sweetly added that she FaceTimed her kids, who told her, "You always say we can do hard things, mama. Now we’re telling you the same thing. You got this. We love you."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jenna has spoken out about her relationship with Stephanie, while her ex remains mum.</h2><p>Stephanie, who has an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> account, but hasn't posted anything in months, also has never shared a photo of Jenna.
