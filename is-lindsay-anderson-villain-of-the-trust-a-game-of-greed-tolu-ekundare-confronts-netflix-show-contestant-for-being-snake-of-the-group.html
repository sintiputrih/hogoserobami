But I just wanted to lay everything out on the table."</p><p>Winnie then claimed that Lindsay was behind every elimination which seemed to be quite true as she was the one who voted out Juelz Morgan and Bryce Lee and never told anyone about that.</p><p>Winnie noted, "You have single-handedly had a hand at everybody that has went home and I don't know if you've told them or not, but you single-handedly had a hand in everyone going home."</p><p>Tolu Ekundare chimed in and said, "For you to look in our face and know that you've had an undercover motive the entire time is terrifying and you'll, yeah, she shared some stuff from this side of the camp with you guys, but trust and believe, that has also gone both ways."</p><p>She tried to convince other contestants to vote out Lindsay and said, "She'll come and 'Let me go talk to the boys, let me see what they're up to.
