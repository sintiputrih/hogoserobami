They also found nearly 1,300 online ads for sex at the parlor that were posted in the last five years.</p><p>Eventually, four people were busted for prostitution as the city took legal action to shut the shady business down.</p><p>The city attorney is also imposing more than $100,000 in civil penalties and reimbursement for legal costs, Fox said.</p><p>“The owners of Ocean Spa have been masquerading as a legitimate business for far too long,” city attorney Mara Elliott said in a press release.</p><p>“Ocean Spa is a sex shop – not a massage parlor – and it has no place in our community or anywhere else.

Gavin Newsom said when he signed it.</p><p>“My administration will monitor crime and prosecution trends for any possible unintended consequences and will act to mitigate any such impacts.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The city is seeking $100,000 in civil penalties and reimbursement for legal fees, Fox said. <span class=credit>cbs8.com</span></figure><p>But some business owners have argued it has emboldened prostitutes and their pimps.</p><p>“It’s always been pretty common with massage parlors to offer more than massages,”&nbsp; the business owner said. “But with [the new law] the whole industry is emboldened because they know nothing will happen.”</p><p>“The prostitution has steadily increased,” the entrepreneur continued.</p><p>“Pimps know they can flood the streets with more girls, and with the busiest boarder crossing here in San Diego, sex trafficking is out of control.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2tmaWxfo7K4v46snLFlnqS2tLHSZp2rp51iwKK6jJ2gnp%2BfYrqiv9Kanp5loJa%2FrbvRZqCnrJWnv7a802aaoa2imLVuv8SrraKblah6rbHAnWStp12lv7C%2F06KrrqyZpLturtSsq2aqlaW8s8CO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rafael-de-la-fuente-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-147045-html.html><span>←</span><span>Rafael De La Fuente Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
