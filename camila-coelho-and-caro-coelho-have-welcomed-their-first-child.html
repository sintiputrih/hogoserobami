The Elaluz creator announced the news on Instagram, revealing that the newborn boy was born on August 5. Camila Coelho’s tweet included a carousel of photographs of her kid gripping her finger and her husband cradling the newborn. It also included emotional footage of the new mother in the hospital saying, “Thank you very much, God.”</p><p>In the caption, the 34-year-old new mother wrote:</p><p>“Our angel has arrived!”</p><p>Kai Coelho was born on August 5, 22nd, at 8:52 p.m. (My tears of happiness when I heard him crying after almost 24 hours in labor). We are very thankful he is still alive and with us.”&nbsp;Camila Coelho revealed her pregnancy in March during an interview with Vogue Brazil, saying she was overjoyed to have conceived after a “delicate journey.”</p><p>Coelho stated:</p><p>“These last 23 weeks have honestly been the happiest of my life.” After a difficult road filled with anxiety and anguish, God has rewarded us with the most precious gift of all, the one we have longed for – OUR BABY!!!”</p><h2>Camila Coelho documents her pregnant experience on Instagram.</h2><p>Following her formal announcement with Vogue, the native of Virginopolis assured her 9.8 million Instagram followers that “DREAMS DO COME TRUE!”&nbsp;Camila Coelho also admitted in the article that her epilepsy caused her “a lot of dread and frustration.” As a youngster, the fashionista was diagnosed with epilepsy.</p><p>Coelho stated in an interview with Elle how this gave her an optimistic approach during her pregnancy from the start. She stated:</p><p>“When the baby was a fetus, I remember thinking to myself, ‘This kid is healthy, this baby is developing nicely, and he’s going to be a lovely child.'” He’s going to be born flawless.’ Reassuring myself has improved my mental health and will influence how the baby develops.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Camila-Coelho-3.jpg alt="Camila Coelho" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The businesswoman also disclosed that in order to prevent congenital problems, she had to arrange her pregnancy with medical support. While documenting her prenatal experience, the new mom also vowed to preserve honesty with her fans.&nbsp;The influencer was able to turn her baby belly into an item. Coelho kept posting pictures of her clothing on Instagram, which usually showed off her gorgeous baby belly.&nbsp;Throughout her pregnancy, Coelho made certain that she did not see her body-altering negatively. Despite her weight increase, she resolved to eat healthily and exercise frequently. However, she allowed herself to succumb to pregnancy urges.</p><p>During the interview, she stated:</p><p>“I never stopped eating carbohydrates, chocolate, or anything like that – I simply made sure I was extremely active throughout pregnancy and consuming all the wonderful things the baby needed.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Camila-Coelho-2.jpg alt="Camila Coelho" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Camila and Caro married in 2010.
