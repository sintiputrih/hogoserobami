However, Cassie and the rapper settled the suit only 24 hours after the filing, in what may be one of the fastest-to-resolve public abuse settlements in recent years.</p><p>The pair, who began dating in 2007, did not make their <a href=#>relationship official</a> until 2012. They were spotted together at events on several occasions, and Cassie even took photographs with <a href=#>Diddy's children</a> Justin Dior Combs and Christian Combs at a Pre-Grammy Gala in 2018. So, how did the pair go from this — to a rape and abuse lawsuit?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Cassie and Diddy settle so quickly?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>“I am very proud of Ms. Ventura for having the strength to go public with her lawsuit. She ought to be commended for doing so,” said Douglas Wigdor, Cassie's attorney.</p><p>Cassie's disturbing allegations include rape and domestic abuse. She also claimed that her famous ex used his powerful network to keep her trapped in the relationship.</p><p>Her lawyer told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a> before the settlement was reached that she was offered “eight figures" to silence the accusations, and not file the suit. She rejected the offer.</p><p>Then, the two celebrities conferenced with their lawyers on November 17 and reached a deal that sources told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">news outlets</a> met Cassie and Diddy's "mutual satisfaction.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Cassie decided to settle her lawsuit with Diddy for control.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Getty Images</a></figure><p>Cassie gave a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC News</a> about why she settled so quickly: to maintain power.</p><p>“I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control. I want to thank my family, fans, and lawyers for their unwavering support,” she said.</p><p>One of her supporters was <a href=#>Alex Fine,</a> her husband who already had <a href=#>unsettled beef</a> with Diddy even before Cassie filed the lawsuit. Their feud began after Diddy released “Gotta Move On” in 2022, which is about a woman starting a new relationship with a man she barely knows.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Getty Images</a><p>Cassie, Diddy, Christian Combs, and Justin Dior Comb at the Clive Davis and Recording Academy Pre-GRAMMY in 2018</p></figure><p>Meanwhile, Diddy has maintained his innocence of the charges Cassie filed against him. His lawyer, Benjamin Brafman told news outlets that Diddy “vehemently denies these offensive and outrageous allegations,” and that the lawsuit was, “riddled with baseless and outrageous lies” after a failed attempt to blackmail Combs into paying her $30 million.</p><p>Following the settlement, Diddy's statement said in part that he wishes Cassie and her family, "all the best."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK60v8ieZJqmlGKxqrDDsmSsnaSpuaY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andrea-hernandez-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-198019-html.html><span>←</span><span>Andrea Hernandez Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
