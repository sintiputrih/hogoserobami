Overall, fans love tuning in to see what he is going to say next. Sure, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kevin Durant</a>, might hate him, but who actually cares? Barkley's role is to give analysis, be entertaining, and poke the bear. At the end of the day, that is exactly what he does, and it is very hard to hate on him for it. Besides, the man is a legend for crying out loud.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Additionally, Charles Barkley has been in the news a bit more as of late thanks to a shoe he wore in the 90s. Of course, we are talking about the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Nike Air Max CB 94.</a> This is a shoe that came out in, you guessed it, 1994. Although it hasn't gotten a ton of shine over the years, it is now making a huge comeback. Overall, fans have enjoyed these new colorways, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">as evidenced by the numbers they are doing here at </a>HNHH. A couple of colorways have been shown off, including this new "Light Iron Ore" model, pictured below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-more-charles-barkley-sneakers>More Charles Barkley Sneakers</h2></span><p>Image via Nike</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the official images both above and below, you can see how this Charles Barkley signature matches his build and personality. At the end of the day, these embody the 90s Nike Basketball aesthetics. As far as the colorway is concerned, it is very clean. Firstly, we get grey all throughout the upper. Secondly, black is heavily placed on the midsole, tongue, and the straps. Lastly, we get nice pops of orange all the way throughout the shoe.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As far as release dates are concerned, nothing has been announced as of yet. However, these are expected to drop for a price of $170 USD. If you like shoes that have a ton of character within them, these are a must-cop.
