Kelly was returned to the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC). Once there, he was soon placed on suicide watch. However, according to Kelly and his lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, that move was unwarranted and so, they sued the prison. "Mr. Kelly was placed on suicide watch for purely punitive reasons in violation of his Eighth Amendment rights," she argued in a statement obtained by <a href=#>Page Six</a>.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Bonjean added that she had spoken to her client who was adamant that he was doing fine, before slamming the facility and its actions, claiming, "MDC Brooklyn is being run like a gulag." She argued that Kelly didn't deserve to face the conditions he was being subjected to because he wasn't suicidal. "They are stripped of their clothing and underwear and forced to wear a smock made of material akin to the blankets moving companies use when they wrap up furniture," she said. "They are denied utensils for eating; They cannot shower or shave." Speaking with <a href=#>CNN</a>, Bonjean claimed, "It's punishment for being high-profile, and it's horrifying frankly."</p><p dir=ltr>Days later, on July 5, prosecutors confirmed in a memo seen by <a href=#>Page Six</a> that the lawsuit was now rendered irrelevant. They wrote, "Following a clinical assessment, Plaintiff Robert Sylvester Kelly, also known as 'R. Kelly,' was removed from suicide watch as of this morning."</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know is having suicidal thoughts, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline​ by dialing 988 or by calling 1-800-273-TALK (8255)​.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma29hbn1ye8inqqKclWK%2FbrfEpaOyq12htqexjKKlZqiinsCwuo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-corsair-rm850x-2018-psu-review.html><span>←</span><span>Final Words &amp;amp; Conclusion - The Corsair RM850x (2018) PSU Review: Exceptional Electrical Performance</span></a>
