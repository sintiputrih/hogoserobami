There is also an added issue of the motherboard remaining consistent, depending on how the motherboard manufacturer wants to add in their own boosting technologies over the ones that the CPU manufacturer would prefer they used. In order to remain consistent, we implement an OS-level unique high performance mode on all the CPUs we test which should override any motherboard manufacturer performance mode.</p><p><b>HandBrake v0.9.9: </b><a href=#><b>link</b></a></p><p>For HandBrake, we take two videos (a 2h20 640x266 DVD rip and a 10min double UHD 3840x4320 animation short) and convert them to x264 format in an MP4 container. Results are given in terms of the frames per second processed, and HandBrake uses as many threads as possible.</p><p><img alt="HandBrake v0.9.9 LQ Film" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph8426/67027.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img alt="HandBrake v0.9.9 2x4K" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph8426/67025.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The variable turbo speeds of the CPUs results in a small difference in low quality conversion, and the high single core frequency of the 4790K wins there. For 4K conversion the problem becomes more parallel and the extra cores of the 5960X push it ahead of the pack. The 5930K and 5820K are both behind the 4960X however.</p><p><b>Agisoft Photoscan – 2D to 3D Image Manipulation: </b><a href=#><b>link</b></a></p><p>Agisoft Photoscan creates 3D models from 2D images, a process which is very computationally expensive. The algorithm is split into four distinct phases, and different phases of the model reconstruction require either fast memory, fast IPC, more cores, or even OpenCL compute devices to hand. Agisoft supplied us with a special version of the software to script the process, where we take 50 images of a stately home and convert it into a medium quality model. This benchmark typically takes around 15-20 minutes on a high end PC on the CPU alone, with GPUs reducing the time.</p><p><img alt="Agisoft PhotoScan Benchmark - Total Time" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph8426/67028.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Photoscan's four separate components rely on different amounts of high frequency vs. many cores: check our <a href=#>Bench</a> database for more detailed results but overall the 5960X comes out on top. That being said, the 5820K is less than 40% of the price and is only 1.2 minutes behind.</p><p><b>Dolphin Benchmark: </b><a href=#><b>link</b></a></p><p>Many emulators are often bound by single thread CPU performance, and general reports tended to suggest that Haswell provided a significant boost to emulator performance. This benchmark runs a Wii program that raytraces a complex 3D scene inside the Dolphin Wii emulator. Performance on this benchmark is a good proxy of the speed of Dolphin CPU emulation, which is an intensive single core task using most aspects of a CPU. Results are given in minutes, where the Wii itself scores 17.53 minutes.</p><p><img alt="Dolphin Emulation Benchmark" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph8426/67029.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Dolphon loves single core speed and efficiency, meaning the 4790K wins out again. Interestingly the large L3 cache of the 5960X also helps here against the 5820K, despite the 5820K having a higher single thread frequency.</p><p><b>WinRAR 5.0.1: </b><a href=#><b>link</b></a></p><p><img alt="WinRAR 5.01, 2867 files, 1.52 GB" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph8426/67030.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>WinRAR is a variable thread workload, but more cores still wins out. Interestingly the xx60X CPUs are ahead of the xx30K CPUs followed by the xx20K. After this comes the 4790K, and then the 990X on par, showing how far three generations of Intel CPU have developed.</p><p><b>PCMark8 v2 OpenCL</b></p><p>A new addition to our CPU testing suite is PCMark8 v2, where we test the Work 2.0 and Creative 3.0 suites in OpenCL mode.</p><p><img alt="PCMark8 v2 Work 2.0 OpenCL with R7 240 DDR3" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph8426/67031.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img alt="PCMark8 v2 Creative 3.0 OpenCL with R7 240 DDR3" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph8426/67032.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>PCMark v8 relies on a number of factors, and it would seem that frequency is preferred over cache and memory. Interestingly the 4930K beat the 4960X in the Creative Suite with no obvious explanation.</p><p><b>Hybrid x265: <a href=#>link</a></b></p><p>Hybrid is a new benchmark, where we take a 4K 1500 frame video and convert it into an x265 format without audio. Results are given in frames per second.</p><p><img alt="Hybrid x265, 4K Video" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph8426/67033.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Converting 4K video gets another step in the preference for more cores in Hybrid x265. The 5820K matches the 3960X, showing the progression of CPU generational development.</p><p><b>Cinebench R15</b></p><p><img alt="Cinebench R15 - Single Threaded" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph8426/67034.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img alt="Cinebench R15 - Multi-Threaded" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph8426/67035.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><b>3D Particle Movement</b></p><p>3DPM is a self-penned benchmark, taking basic 3D movement algorithms used in Brownian Motion simulations and testing them for speed. High floating point performance, MHz and IPC wins in the single thread version, whereas the multithread version has to handle the threads and loves more cores.</p><p><img alt="3D Particle Movement: Single Threaded" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph8426/67036.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img alt="3D Particle Movement: MultiThreaded" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph8426/67037.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><b>FastStone Image Viewer 4.9</b></p><p>FastStone is the program I use to perform quick or bulk actions on images, such as resizing, adjusting for color and cropping. In our test we take a series of 170 images in various sizes and formats and convert them all into 640x480 .gif files, maintaining the aspect ratio. FastStone does not use multithreading for this test, and results are given in seconds.</p><p><img alt="FastStone Image Viewer 4.9" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph8426/67038.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>FastStone is a purely single threaded exercise, showing here how the lower core CPUs with high turbo perfom best, and by quite a margin.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIV1fpVoq6GdXZ67tbHLZp%2Baq6eaua15xGaaqa1dp7K3tcSwZJynopp6qoOMbnBvaKhitnh5lHJqaaNdnoRugZdrZ6RlpJrAtbHDaGw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./candis-cayne.html><span>←</span><span>Candis Cayne- Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Career</span></a>
