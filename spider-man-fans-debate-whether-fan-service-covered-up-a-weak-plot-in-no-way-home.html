That being said, it increasingly looks as though fans are questioning Marvel about whether it is actually living up to the high bar of the Infinity Saga, or simply riding on its success by leaning into nostalgic elements, a continuation of which philosophy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">is also apparent in the latest Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqqmhlJq%2FbrnAp2SfmZ6oeqWxwZqrnmWnnbK1tMSrZJ%2BZnmLApr7VopqeZZOkw6a%2BxJ1krqhdlnq4scCkZKmkn6l6qrqMp6Zmr5Gueqm7zJ5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kristina-kuzmic.html><span>←</span><span>Kristina Kuzmic</span></a>
