It has been a week since it happened and now he has received some backing from another AEW star.</p><p>This all started from&nbsp;<a href=#>a troll tweet from The USA Network account</a>. This led to Tony Khan going to Twitter to defend his booking decisions and his company. He pointed out a “double standard,” drawing a comparison between Jinder Mahal’s win-loss record and the record of HOOK, the AEW World Champion contender.</p><p>“A double standard: @730hook 28-1 career record, on winning streak calls out the Champ, a logical challenge sparks online outrage Jinder has literally lost every single match he’s in for the past year, immediately gets title shot, where is the rage #AEWDynamite TOMORROW on TBS.“</p><p>Jinder Mahal&nbsp;<a href=#>had very apt response to Tony Khan</a>&nbsp;and got a ton of support from others online. Even&nbsp;<a href=#>Booker T recently came to Jinder Mahal’s defense</a>&nbsp;and criticized Tony Khan for his bizarre rant.</p><p>While speaking on <a href=#>Sporting Tribune</a>, Powerhouse Hobbs asked to comment on Tony Khan’s Twitter antics and the drama surrounding them. Hobbs expressed that Khan’s actions stem from a genuine belief in his company and roster. According to Hobbs, if someone believes wholeheartedly in something, it’s essential to speak their mind, and Khan is doing just that.</p><p>“It’s his company. He believes in us, and if you believe in something, speak your mind. If you’re 100% sure on it, speak your mind. If you’re 99% sure on it, don’t speak on it. He’s 100% sure and he’s speaking his mind. He believes in his company and he believes in us.”</p><p>Tony Khan’s controversial <a href=#>Twitter antics embarrassed many backstage in AEW as well</a>. The AEW President <a href=#>faced criticism for allowing tweets to affect him</a> during the social media rant. Despite the heated exchanges, some fans express hope that Tony Khan will eventually recognize that participating in such petty antics may potentially harm his reputation without necessarily yielding positive results for the company.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What do you think of what Powerhouse Hobbs had to say?
