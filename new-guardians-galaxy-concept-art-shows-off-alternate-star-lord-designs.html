That’s evident from this latest batch of artwork courtesy of Andy Park, as he’s shared some amazing new shots of his early versions of Peter Quill/Star-Lord – <a href=#>which were teased last week</a>.</p>[zergpaid]<p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>As you can see, these take a different approach to the helmet, giving it an older look than the technologically advanced version worn by Chris Pratt on the big screen. The costume also incorporates some armour, and it’s clear that Marvel may have had some very different ideas for Guardians of the Galaxy when these images were dreamt up several years ago.</p><p data-characters=497 data-current-count=859 data-injectable=false>After all, it’s hard to imagine this version of Star-Lord fitting into the aesthetic which director James Gunn brought with him, but regardless, it still would have been very cool to see a version of <strong>Guardians of the Galaxy</strong> where this type of concept art would have worked. With any luck, Park will share some designs for the other members of the team in the near future. Until that happens though, give us your thoughts on this alternate costume for Star-Lord in the comments section below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJopZ6vXZzCor7Dopinq12crq2t17JknKeemLKxwIyaqa1lo528uL%2BMqJ2fZZGhwaa%2BzZqrnmWjqa6zecuoqZ1llJrAqrPNrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./keanu-reeves-bio-age-height-career-wife-children-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Keanu Reeves Bio, Age, Height, Career, Wife, Children, Net Worth</span></a>
