From her chart-topping hits to her trendsetting fashion, she's been a constant source of fascination. But what truly makes her captivating is not just her talent but her natural allure — a fact not lost on her husband, Blake Shelton.</p><p class=Fg>In a candid interview with Access Hollywood, Shelton couldn't contain his admiration for Stefani's enthralling beauty. He playfully admitted that he had secretly hoped that their marriage would somehow bestow upon him some of Stefani's extraordinary genetics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/6c39402eb9f72e5a874b3c3ccb51af8f0aab0f4792d1483f709cc160e777dbe8.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Gwen Stefani on The Voice - Season 22 Live Finale Part 2 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>With a grin, he shared his <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m0zT4UIHes&t=924s">fantasy</a> of waking up in the morning, flexing his stomach muscles, and stretching his legs, mimicking his wife's grace and effortless beauty. He may have lived with Stefani for years, but he still doesn't understand how Stefani remains so beautiful, and he's constantly in awe of her.</p><p class=Fg>Shelton's admiration for Stefani's natural beauty extends far beyond that one interview. In 2017, when he was awarded the title of People's Sexiest Man Alive, he wasted no time in expressing his admiration for his then-girlfriend.</p><p class=Fg>He didn't just praise her signature winged cat-eye and bold red lipstick, he believed <a class="Xd a" href=#>Stefani</a> looked her most beautiful when she embraced her natural beauty, free of any makeup. According to him, Stefani's allure is at its peak when she wears no makeup whatsoever. He emphasized that she is ageless and her youthful looks are simply unbelievable.</p><p class=Fg>While <a class="Xd a" href=#>Shelton</a> acknowledges that Stefani can rock red lips — he even highlighted her "Revlon red" lips in his song "Turnin' Me On" from his latest album — he yearns for the world to witness the Stefani he knows, hidden away from the spotlight. He expressed that when she gets all dolled up, she's undeniably beautiful, with her red lips being her signature. Nonetheless, he find her stunning even without makeup. He <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/style/blake-shelton-loves-gwen-stefani-no-makeup/>added</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"The Gwen that nobody gets to see is the one that you all should see."</p><p class=Fg>In Shelton's eyes, Stefani, despite being a mother of three, defies the passage of time, retaining the vivacity of someone far younger. He remains astounded by the genetics that seem to have graced her with an everlasting youthfulness.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/38733871fba4a30415c45d30eb62b158bd913b996ff70f711f4ee3c56f325a9a.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani attended the 48th AFI Life Achievement Award Gala Tribute. | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>Gwen Stefani's Makeup-Free Selfie</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg>This appreciation for Stefani's makeup-free allure casts our minds back to May 2016 when she graced her Instagram with a striking picture of herself, completely devoid of makeup. It was a moment of authenticity that reverberated through social media, with fans expressing their heartfelt admiration.</p><p class=Fg>Fans from all corners of the world seemed to concur with Shelton's sentiments.
