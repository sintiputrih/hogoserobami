Many elements of the series are the same across borders, allowing singles to date, sight unseen, and test whether the age-old adage really holds up.</p><p data-characters=577 data-current-count=949 data-injectable=true>With several more iterations — shifting locations to Argentina, Germany, and the U.K. — currently in development, its clear there’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">no stopping the Love is Blind franchise</a>. Its only getting more popular with its branching versions, and Love is Blind: Sweden is among the most sought-after. The series aired its first four episodes in mid-January, hooking viewers and luring them in, only to leave us hanging following the engaged couple’s first few nights of their collective honeymoon. Fresh episodes are incoming, but Netflix seems keen to keep fans waiting.</p><h2 id=h-love-is-blind-sweden-s-release-schedule data-injectable=false>Love is Blind: Sweden‘s release schedule</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true>As noted above, the first (almost) half of Love is Blind: Sweden arrived on Netflix on Jan. 12. The first four episodes landed on the streamer all at once, and took viewers through the singles’ initial meeting, dating in the pods, proposals, and early honeymoon.</p><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false>The next four episodes will likewise arrive on Netflix all at the same time, this time on Friday, Jan. 19. They will likely take viewers all the way to the altar, but leave the actual wedding episodes to drop separately. Those final two episodes of the season, which will feature the final “I dos,” will follow the first eight a week later, on Jan. 26 and Jan. 29.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=781 data-injectable=true>There are likely to be even more episodes in the future, following the big weddings. Love is Blind typically <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">features a reunion episode</a>, which allows the show’s participants to come back together around a year after filming concludes and discuss their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">experience on the program</a>. That will likely follow within a few weeks, at most a few months, after the final episodes of the typical season drop.</p><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=201 data-injectable=false>Eventually we may get even more additions, including those “After the Altar” glimpses into the couples’ post-wedding life, but they likely won’t follow for months at a minimum.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMSnZJ2nXaOyuHnEqaCsp5SawG67xWajqK6VYra0ecGloKecXajEprDEp2SrnZyarrSxjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vantile-whitfield-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Vantile Whitfield Net Worth</span></a>
