Her best-known marriages are with musicians Tommy Lee (from 1995 to 1998)&nbsp;and Kid Rock (a few months in 2006), but she also has three other ex-husbands.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from her much-publicized rock star marriages, her most tumultuous one has been with poker player Rick Salomon, whom she's married and divorced two different times (per <a href=#>E! Online</a>). They first married in 2007, but the marriage was annulled in early 2008. They gave it another go in 2014, but after six months, she filed for divorce.&nbsp;After Salomon, Anderson's next marriage appeared to be a brief, 12-day union with producer Jon Peters in 2020 — though, as Anderson later revealed (via <a href=#>People</a>), they weren't legally married. Most recently, Anderson married her bodyguard in late 2020. Per <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>, she filed for divorce in January 2022.</p><p>Anderson has also had long-term relationships that didn't lead to marriage, including one with French soccer player Adil Rami (pictured), whom she dated for two years (via <a href=#>Bleacher Report</a>). In 2019, Anderson announced the split in a lengthy Instagram missive (visible on Paris Match journalist Clémentine Rebillat's <a href=#>Twitter</a>), making allegations of two-timing and abuse against Rami.&nbsp;</p><p>If you or someone you know is dealing with domestic abuse, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233.
