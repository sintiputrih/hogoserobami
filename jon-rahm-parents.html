From a very young age, Rahm displayed a natural talent for sports, and it wasn’t long before he started playing golf.&nbsp;</p><p>Inspired by the 1997 Ryder Cup in Valderrama, Rahm’s parents, Edorta Rahm and Ángela Rodríguez, encouraged his interest in golf, which eventually became his passion.</p><p>Rahm’s dedication and hard work in pursuing his golf career have led to significant achievements.&nbsp;</p><p>He has become one of the top golfers in the world, winning numerous accolades, including the 2021 U.S. Open and representing Spain in international golf competitions.</p><p>Rahm’s interest in golf was further nurtured at the Centro Nacional de Golf in Madrid, Spain, where he honed his golfing skills.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite participating in other sports, such as soccer and canoeing, Rahm left these activities at the age of 14 to focus on his golf career.</p><p>Rahm attended IES Ortega y Gassett high school in Madrid, where he won several European golf competitions, including the Jacques Léglise Trophy in 2011 and the Bonallack Trophy in 2012.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jon-Rahm-wins-the-2023-Masters-683x1024.jpg><p>Rahm’s father recognized the potential for better career opportunities in the United States and encouraged him to apply for college there.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2012, Rahm received a golf scholarship and enrolled at Arizona State University, where he was recruited by golf coach Tim Mickelson.</p><p>His time at Arizona State University allowed him to further develop his golfing skills and compete against top-tier competition.</p><p>Rahm’s success on the golf course is a testament to his hard work, dedication, and passion for the sport. He has also been recognized for his sportsmanship and <a href=#>leadership</a> qualities.&nbsp;</p><p>Rahm’s achievements have brought attention not only to himself but also to Spain’s golfing <a href=#>community</a>, inspiring young golfers to pursue their dreams.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jon Rahm Parents supported him in his career journey</h2><p>Raised in Barrika, a small town in the Basque country of Spain, Jon Rahm grew up alongside his older brother, Eriz Rahm, and was introduced to golf by his parents.</p><p>His father, Edorta Rahm, works in the gasoline industry, while his mother, Ángela Rodríguez, is a midwife.</p><p>At a young age, Rahm started playing golf and became an instructor. He learned English by listening to hip-hop music and graduated from Arizona State University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communications after receiving a golf scholarship.</p><p>Despite coming from a small, modest home, Rahm had a happy childhood and maintained a close <a href=#>relationship</a> with his family. His brother works as a set designer at the Palacio Euskalduna, a theater in Bilbao.</p><p>When the Rahm <a href=#>family</a> first became interested in golf, they started playing at the Martiartu sports club, even though it was not a golf club.&nbsp;</p><p>They later joined the Larrabee golf club, an hour’s drive from their home, as the nearest golf clubs were too expensive for them. Rahm’s father would drop him off at Larrabea to play golf while he went to play with his friends.&nbsp;</p><p>One day, a friend suggested that Edorta Rahm take Jon to the Spanish children’s championship, and after noticing his son’s talent for golf, he encouraged him to pursue the sport more seriously.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Edorta-Rahm-And-Angela-Rodriguez-1024x536.jpg><p>According to Edorta Rahm, the father of Jon Rahm, he is proud of his son’s achievements in golf, even though he admits that his son has always been highly competitive and occasionally had a bad temper.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, he acknowledges that his son has developed significantly over the years, and he is now more focused on his family life.</p><p>Despite his son’s previous outbursts, Edorta Rahm takes pride in the positive comments his son makes about his family and his role as a father. It appears that he recognizes Jon’s growth and maturation in recent times.</p><p>Rahm’s golf coach, Eduardo Celles, first noticed his talent when Rahm was around 13 years old. Celles, who came from a family of golf teachers, coached Rahm for two years and helped him improve his game.</p><p>Rahm’s passion for golf became evident from a young age, and he spent many hours practicing putting in front of the house when his family rented a house on a golf course during weekends and summers.</p><p>Despite his success as a golfer, Rahm’s mother sees him as her son first and is proud of his accomplishments. Rahm credits his parents for instilling in him values such as hard work and discipline that have been crucial to his success.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jon Rahm marked his second major championship</h2><p>Jon Rahm’s relentless drive to improve and succeed in his golf career culminated in his victory at the 87th Masters held at Augusta National Golf Club. He secured his win with a final round of 69, which included four birdies, finishing at 12-under.</p><p>On the other hand, <a href=#>Brooks Koepka</a>, who led by four strokes, struggled to maintain his momentum in the final round, ending with a score of 74.</p><p>Rahm’s recent victory marked his second major championship win, with his first being the U.S. Open in 2021. He is now one of the two players from Spain to achieve this feat, the other being Seve Ballesteros.</p><p>Rahm’s win at Augusta will be regarded as a significant milestone in his career, and fans will eagerly anticipate what other accomplishments he will achieve in the future.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC2zqdkq5mYonqxrdGepa2rXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./syndaver-labs-net-worth-2024-2.html><span>←</span><span>Syndaver Labs Net Worth 2024</span></a>
