The test period provides time for the department to study the revenue generating potential of the available parking spaces after hours.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Historically, the available parking at Lahaina Harbor has been managed only on weekdays during regular business hours while the harbor office is staffed,”</span> said Edward Underwood, division administrator. “In the evening, on weekends and holidays, there has been little enforcement and boat owners with vessels in the harbor have had a difficult time finding parking there.</p><p><span class=quotations>“With round-the-clock attendance provided by Diamond, parking availability for permit-holders will be much more reliable, and in the evening, on weekends and holidays the unused parking stalls will still generate revenue,”</span> said Underwood.</p><p>The parking plan is similar to parking plans instituted at Maalaea Small Boat Harbor and Ala Wai Small Boat Harbor on Oahu. Ala Wai’s parking concession generates, on average, $62,500 per month in fees. Maalaea’s parking brings in about $3,100 per month.</p><p>The Board of Land and Natural Resources approved the Lahaina Harbor parking vendor plan at its May 13, 2016, meeting.</p><p>Parking concession proceeds go into the boating special fund, which supports the state’s small-boat harbors.</p><p>Today's breaking news and more in your inbox</p><a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a><p>The Maui News Maui County Department of Finance Director Scott Teruya was placed on administrative leave on last ...</p><a href=#></a><p>Holy Innocents Episcopal Church, formerly on Front Street in Lahaina Town and destroyed by the fire, announced the ...</p><a href=#></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3UoqWer6NjsLC5jqecsKtfobykrctmpZ6vo2R%2FcX2WaGdyZ56axG68wKuioqaXYr2trc1mnqido2K2r8DOZpyfnpWYwW6t02ajmqCRnruieceaqZunomQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./massive-mudslide-slides-down-mountain-blocks-road-in-little-cottonwood-canyon-mud-rocks-lcc-utah-traffic-runoff-state-route-210.html><span>←</span><span>Massive mudslide rolls down mountain, blocks road in Little Cottonwood Canyon</span></a>
